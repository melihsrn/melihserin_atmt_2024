Prépare-toi pour le voyage, je te prie.
Je pense que Tom est un joli nom.
Je ne sais pas qui a fait ça.
Je note tout ; je me sens mal à l'aise sans mon carnet.
Ça clarifie les choses.
Tu es bon.
Je ne vois guère de choix.
Je ne veux tout simplement pas vous voir être blessée.
Êtes-vous marié ou célibataire ? Vivez-vous seul ou en couple ?
Le ciel est dégagé. Pas un nuage en vue.
Je ne vous en empêche pas.
Pisser assise n'est pas si mauvais.
Regarde ceux-ci !
Est-il gentil avec toi ?
Nous avons toujours assez de temps, si nous l'utilisons correctement.
Tom est aussi grand que n'importe quel autre élève de la classe.
Jusqu'à présent, tout s'est bien passé.
Devine ce qui m'est arrivé !
Ton avenir commence aujourd'hui.
Je crois que c'est dangereux pour les enfants de nager dans ce lac.
Tout le monde connaît son nom.
Votre sœur est en train de dormir.
Tu as acheté plus de timbres que nécessaire.
Une énorme station spatiale en orbite autour de Jupiter survolait les bandes arc-en-ciel de la géante gazeuse.
Les blessés furent évacués du lieu de l'accident.
Le train arrive !
Je vous paierai.
Elle était malade.
J'ai un manteau, mais je n'ai pas de chapeau.
Je connais le remède à ce qui vous fait souffrir.
Je veux simplement que tout le monde vive.
Ils sont contents du résultat.
Ne sois pas timide. Ta prononciation est plus ou moins correcte.
L’air était humide et tiède.
Bien sûr que nous te croyons.
Je veux voir Tom.
Ça m'a presque fait peur de ne pas te voir connectée pendant toute une journée.
Elle n'a pas de poitrine.
Cet article est plus intéressant que le précédent.
Frappez-vous vos enfants ?
La beauté plaît aux yeux, la douceur charme l'âme.
Notre plan s'est mal goupillé dès le départ.
Je n'aime pas apprendre aux enfants à nager quand leurs parents sont à côté.

Je ne crois pas que ce soit arrivé de cette manière.
Je ne compte pas au nombre de tes amis.
Je voulais simplement une clarification.
Soucions-nous de cela plus tard.
Il s'est fait mal au doigt avec une aiguille.
Elle a fait de son mieux pour le sauver.
J'ai inventé un moyen de générer davantage d'argent.
Ce travail me déprime.
Je ne t'ai pas tout conté.
La prophétie s'est avérée.
Je déteste les gens qui ont des sentiments.
Bon week-end.
"Bon, tu sors avec moi si je ne redouble pas ?" "Les "si" ne m'intéressent pas".
J'ai quelque chose de meilleur en tête.
Tous les génies ne sont pas des ingénieurs, mais tous les ingénieurs sont des génies. L'ensemble de tous les ingénieurs est donc un sous-ensemble, malheureusement propre, de tous les génies.
Je ne pense pas que quiconque pense que tu sois fou.
Tom ignora nos conseils.
Nous en aurons terminé avant une heure.
Je la vois rire et plaisanter avec eux.
Il fixait son décolleté.
Nous en avons déjà terminé.
Nous ne sommes pas apparentées.
C'est spécieux.
La seule qui puisse résoudre ce problème, c'est toi.
Quel bel arc-en-ciel !
Vous êtes nerveusement usée.
Savez-vous garder un secret ?
Essaie de le tenir serré de toutes tes forces !
As-tu la moindre idée de ce que tu dis ?
À vous entendre, vous n'êtes pas complètement convaincus.
Le garçon a peur d'aller se coucher dans le noir.
Je crois qu'il s'agit de lui.
Tu ne regardes pas.
Es-tu perdu ?

Rien ne vaut le sommeil.
Votre montre a dix minutes de retard.
Je suis étudiant à l'université d'Oxford.
Vous devez venir.
Je sais que tu n'es pas médecin.
Il va neiger demain.
Tu es trop naïve.
Sa barbe était rousse et touffue.
Je me demande s'il est vraiment malade.
Nous avons honte de la pauvreté de notre père.
C'est intrigant.
Je ne savais pas où allait Tom, mais j'avais une bonne idée d'où il allait.
Je travaille sur ceci depuis des mois.
En quelle année es-tu née ?
Veuillez donc passer quand vous êtes dans le coin !
Il cherche à plaire.
Je n'ai pas saisi ton nom de famille.
Nous sommes tous deux témoins.
Vous vous sentirez mieux après un bain.
Tu n'as pas la permission de faire ça.
Je n'ai pas besoin de quelconque repos.
Tous prirent part aux négociations.
Son père ne viendra pas, il est très occupé.
L'hospitalisation du patient prit fin.
Penses-tu que Tom peut revenir ?

Cette robe vous irait bien.
Je te dis la vérité.
Elle portait un chemisier rouge.
Je suis resté une semaine à la maison.
Il se peut que vous ayez raison.
Toujours.
C'est mou.
La ville était pleine d'activité.
Laissez-le seul.
Je n'avais aucune intention de le faire.
La Terre et le Soleil ne sont que des points minuscules parmi les milliards d'étoiles dans la galaxie de la Voie Lactée.
Je suggère que nous sortions prendre un verre.
Peut-être devrais-tu simplement laisser Tom seul.
Est-ce que tu reconnais l'homme sur cette photo ?
Je veux me joindre à ton équipe.
Ne parlez pas si vite !
J'entends un chat qui gratte à la fenêtre.
Il y a une cafétéria à l'université.

Je suis certain de pouvoir persuader Tom.
Je t'ai dit qu'il allait faire froid ici.
Veux-tu parler de quoi que ce soit ?
Tom veut rester célibataire.
J'attends les vacances d'été avec impatience.
Je fis un rôti.
Est-elle toujours célibataire ?
Elle n'est pas aussi belle que sa sœur aînée.
Il est riche comme Crésus.
N'éludez pas la question !
Pourquoi Tom veut-il cette information ?
Que diriez-vous ?
On ouvre à tous ceux qui frappent.
Tom m'a donné un vélo.
Tom a l'air perdu.
Il a acheté une douzaine d'œufs.
Vous m'avez mal compris.
Je ne connais aucun de ses frères.

Comment vous êtes-vous intéressé à l'art ?
Les chiens ne mordent que rarement, sauf s'ils sont attaqués.
C'est quelque chose que ma sœur n'a jamais eu envie de faire.
Tom a maintenu qu'il était innocent.
C'est un homme friand de cérémonie.
Si seulement tu y avais réfléchi avant de te vanter.
Il a très peur des chiens.
Je vous ferai savoir quand c'est terminé.
Cela est d'aspect ordinaire.
Tu es pâle comme un fantôme.
À plus tard !
Je ne veux vraiment pas en parler.
Pouvez-vous aider à s'occuper des enfants ?
La philosophie est considérée comme difficile.
La radio ne fonctionne pas.
Il est mort depuis cinq ans.

Oui, mais c'est beaucoup de travail.
Elle s'est presque évanouie.
Combien pour l'express ?
Mon père n’est pas à la maison.
Mon livre n'est pas là.
C'est seulement à ce moment que j'ai compris ce qu'il voulait dire.
Pourquoi avez-vous acheté une autre voiture ?
Où tout le monde s'en est-il allé ?
C'est moi qui ai faux.
Tom gagne beaucoup d'argent.
Vous avez beaucoup de téléphones.
Gardez l’œil sur le ballon.
Je me suis brûlé la main avec un fer à repasser.
C'est impossible.
On aime sa mère presque sans le savoir, sans le sentir, car cela est naturel comme de vivre.
Ça m'a fait peur.
Un verre d'eau froide est très rafraîchissant lorsqu'il fait chaud.
Pourriez-vous m'indiquer l'arrêt de bus le plus proche ?
Le ragoût sent délicieusement bon.
Tom parle très vite.
Donnez-moi le livre, s'il vous plaît.
J'ai un petit peu faim.
Pourquoi ta chambre est-elle rose, Tom? - Ho! Avant c'était la chambre de ma sœur.
