qui vous a donné votre surnom ?
le point d&apos; ébullition de l&apos; eau se situe , dans des conditions normales , à cent degrés Celsius .
nous nous en sortons pas mal .
je ne sais que faire ici .
tu m&apos; as coupé l&apos; appétit .
c&apos; est la première fois que je mange dans une pizzeria italienne .
personne ne peut nier le fait .
avant tout , nous ne devons pas être égoïstes .
j&apos; ai des difficultés à me concentrer .
il est constamment perdu dans des pensées nostalgiques .
je resterai impliqué .
ceci est survenu avant la réception de ta lettre .
Tom aime la technologie .
que penses @-@ tu qu&apos; il a fait ?
la plante est bleue .
nous sortons d&apos; ici .
le gouvernement est en cours de refonte de la monnaie afin de tenter d&apos; enrayer la contrefaçon .
la pluie acide n&apos; est pas un phénomène naturel .
nous devrions préserver la beauté du paysage .
je peux nous y faire parvenir plus rapidement .
je ne pense pas que Tom puisse jouer de la trompette .
je pense que ce fait est très important .
j&apos; ignore ce que je te dois .
moins on pense , plus on parle .
elle vous attend à la maison .
je n&apos; arrive pas à trouver quoi que ce soit .
j&apos; y serai à 2 h 30 .
rapporte ces livres sur l &quot; étagère .
faites bon voyage .
le train part tout de suite .
écoutez , je ne veux pas perdre mon boulot .
tu aimes les chats , non ?
ça n&apos; a rien à voir avec ça .
est @-@ ce un pastiche ?
mon père lit toujours le journal avant le petit déjeuner .
Tom m&apos; a dit qu&apos; il avait déjà mangé .
je ferai tout ce que tu veux .
elle joue de la flûte .
ils ont l&apos; air si mignons , ensemble .
Tom essuya ses lunettes .

Ôtez votre manteau et faites comme chez vous .
la valeur d&apos; un homme ne réside pas tant dans ce qu&apos; il a que dans ce qu&apos; il est .
je suis fâché avec les nombres .
avez @-@ vous la moindre idée de qui l&apos; a fait ?
j&apos; ai construit cette niche par mes propres moyens .
Tom n&apos; a pas pu aller au concert parce qu&apos; il avait du travail .
il est fauché .
elle est loin d&apos; être honnête .
il y a de bonnes raisons d&apos; affirmer que Paris était le lieu de fréquentes émeutes même avant la révolution de 1789 .
il me donna un bref aperçu du projet .
si j &quot; étais toi , j&apos; ignorerais ça .
dans ce pays il y a quatre saisons .
je veux un beignet .
je suis incroyablement fatigué .
Tom se comporte bizarrement .
veux @-@ tu qu&apos; il le sache ?
ils ont remporté la médaille d&apos; argent .
tout le monde a l&apos; air soucieux .
je ne suis pas d&apos; accord pour qu&apos; elle y aille seule .
tu as presque raison .
tu vas lui en parler ?
tu es le seul à vouloir faire ça , n&apos; est @-@ ce pas ?
dis à Tom que je serai là dès que je pourrai .
j&apos; ai la meilleure maman du monde !
nous appelons un sandwich &quot; Butterbrot &quot; .
de nombreux jeunes sont sans emploi dans le pays .
j&apos; aurais aimé que vous soyez venu avec nous .

Sami n&apos; était pas amoureux de Layla .
trois personnes peuvent facilement s&apos; asseoir dans ce canapé .
tenez cette chose loin de moi !
Sami a eu une dure journée .
ne vous attendez pas à ce que quiconque vous aide !
le chien est @-@ il en train de nager ?
Prépare @-@ toi pour le voyage , je te prie .
je pense que Tom est un joli nom .
je ne sais pas qui a fait ça .
je note tout ; je me sens mal à l&apos; aise sans mon carnet .
ça clarifie les choses .
tu es bon .
je ne vois guère de choix .
je ne veux tout simplement pas vous voir être blessée .
êtes @-@ vous marié ou célibataire ? vivez @-@ vous seul ou en couple ?
le ciel est dégagé . pas un nuage en vue .
je ne vous en empêche pas .
Pisser assise n&apos; est pas si mauvais .
regarde ceux @-@ ci !
est @-@ il gentil avec toi ?
nous avons toujours assez de temps , si nous l&apos; utilisons correctement .
Tom est aussi grand que n&apos; importe quel autre élève de la classe .
jusqu&apos; à présent , tout s&apos; est bien passé .
Devine ce qui m&apos; est arrivé !
ton avenir commence aujourd&apos; hui .
je crois que c&apos; est dangereux pour les enfants de nager dans ce lac .

le train arrive !
je vous paierai .
elle était malade .
j&apos; ai un manteau , mais je n&apos; ai pas de chapeau .
je connais le remède à ce qui vous fait souffrir .
je veux simplement que tout le monde vive .
ils sont contents du résultat .
ne sois pas timide . ta prononciation est plus ou moins correcte .
l&apos; air était humide et tiède .
bien sûr que nous te croyons .
je veux voir Tom .
ça m&apos; a presque fait peur de ne pas te voir connectée pendant toute une journée .
elle n&apos; a pas de poitrine .
cet article est plus intéressant que le précédent .
Frappez @-@ vous vos enfants ?
la beauté plaît aux yeux , la douceur charme l&apos; âme .
notre plan s&apos; est mal goupillé dès le départ .
je n&apos; aime pas apprendre aux enfants à nager quand leurs parents sont à côté .
c&apos; est l&apos; une des raisons pour lesquelles j&apos; adore Tatoeba .
as @-@ tu encore besoin de thé ?
un enfant ne devrait pas recevoir plus d&apos; argent de poche qu&apos; il n&apos; est nécessaire .
la pizza est froide .
&quot; êtes @-@ vous enseignant ? &quot; &quot; oui , je le suis &quot; .
je fus surpris par son apparition soudaine .
personne ne pouvait le nier .
Tom n&apos; avait plus d&apos; allumettes donc il ne pouvait pas allumer le feu .
je ne suis jamais allée à un match de base @-@ ball professionnel .
Tom est innocent .

nous voulons partir .
je regrette de vous faire des reproches .
Tom dépend @-@ il encore de ses parents ?
je ne crois pas que ce soit arrivé de cette manière .
je ne compte pas au nombre de tes amis .
je voulais simplement une clarification .
Soucions @-@ nous de cela plus tard .
il s&apos; est fait mal au doigt avec une aiguille .
elle a fait de son mieux pour le sauver .
j&apos; ai inventé un moyen de générer davantage d&apos; argent .
ce travail me déprime .
je ne t&apos; ai pas tout conté .
la prophétie s&apos; est avérée .
je déteste les gens qui ont des sentiments .
bon week @-@ end .
&quot; bon , tu sors avec moi si je ne redouble pas ? &quot; &quot; les &quot; si &quot; ne m&apos; intéressent pas &quot; .
j&apos; ai quelque chose de meilleur en tête .
tous les génies ne sont pas des ingénieurs , mais tous les ingénieurs sont des génies . l&apos; ensemble de tous les ingénieurs est donc un sous @-@ ensemble , malheureusement propre , de tous les génies .
je ne pense pas que quiconque pense que tu sois fou .
Tom ignora nos conseils .
nous en aurons terminé avant une heure .
je la vois rire et plaisanter avec eux .
il fixait son décolleté .
nous en avons déjà terminé .
nous ne sommes pas apparentées .
c&apos; est spécieux .
la seule qui puisse résoudre ce problème , c&apos; est toi .
quel bel arc @-@ en @-@ ciel !
vous êtes nerveusement usée .
savez @-@ vous garder un secret ?
essaie de le tenir serré de toutes tes forces !
as @-@ tu la moindre idée de ce que tu dis ?
à vous entendre , vous n&apos; êtes pas complètement convaincus .
le garçon a peur d&apos; aller se coucher dans le noir .
je crois qu&apos; il s&apos; agit de lui .
tu ne regardes pas .
es @-@ tu perdu ?
Tom enfila son manteau et partit .
il est deux heures moins le quart .
puis @-@ je le dire tout haut ?
elle était sur les lieux du crime .
ça n&apos; a aucun foutu sens .
ses yeux souriaient derrière ses lunettes .
Mlle Sato est la nouvelle secrétaire du président .
Tom ne s&apos; occupe pas très bien de ses enfants .
je suis alitée .

il a neigé , hier .
ne sois pas impertinent à mon égard .
je veux t&apos; emmener déjeuner .
j&apos; ignore quand la réunion a commencé mais c&apos; est il y a au moins trente minutes .
ce n&apos; est pas supposé se produire .
il m&apos; a frappée par deux fois .
aide @-@ moi , s&apos; il te plait .
je n&apos; ai jamais eu de contravention pour excès de vitesse .
je n&apos; y vais pas , un point c&apos; est tout .
un poisson bondit hors de l&apos; eau .

vous serez prêtes .
c&apos; était très grossier .
il est en train de peindre sa maison .
Tom ressemble à un étranger .
je détins deux copies du livre .
je l&apos; ai fait dans la précipitation .
dis @-@ moi quel bus prendre pour me rendre en ville , s&apos; il te plait .
dis @-@ moi ce que tu as fait pendant tes vacances .
je pense que tu as besoin de quelqu&apos; un à qui parler .

rien ne vaut le sommeil .
votre montre a dix minutes de retard .
je suis étudiant à l&apos; université d&apos; Oxford .
vous devez venir .
je sais que tu n&apos; es pas médecin .
il va neiger demain .
tu es trop naïve .
sa barbe était rousse et touffue .
je me demande s&apos; il est vraiment malade .
nous avons honte de la pauvreté de notre père .
c&apos; est intrigant .
je ne savais pas où allait Tom , mais j&apos; avais une bonne idée d&apos; où il allait .
je travaille sur ceci depuis des mois .
en quelle année es @-@ tu née ?
veuillez donc passer quand vous êtes dans le coin !
il cherche à plaire .
je n&apos; ai pas saisi ton nom de famille .
nous sommes tous deux témoins .
vous vous sentirez mieux après un bain .
tu n&apos; as pas la permission de faire ça .
je n&apos; ai pas besoin de quelconque repos .
tous prirent part aux négociations .
son père ne viendra pas , il est très occupé .

il y a eu une grosse pluie la nuit dernière .
laisse @-@ la s&apos; en aller !
il y a eu un autre accident .
n&apos; ai @-@ je pas mentionné cela ?
je ne lui ai pas dit que vous veniez .
l&apos; homme était jeune .
tout le monde en est capable .
il a encore des doutes .
l&apos; anglais leur plaît .
écoute , me dit @-@ il d&apos; un ton froid , mon père était roi au pays de Kakongo .
cette robe vous irait bien .
je te dis la vérité .
elle portait un chemisier rouge .
je suis resté une semaine à la maison .
il se peut que vous ayez raison .
toujours .
c&apos; est mou .
la ville était pleine d&apos; activité .
laissez @-@ le seul .
je n&apos; avais aucune intention de le faire .
la Terre et le Soleil ne sont que des points minuscules parmi les milliards d&apos; étoiles dans la galaxie de la Voie Lactée .
je suggère que nous sortions prendre un verre .
peut @-@ être devrais @-@ tu simplement laisser Tom seul .
est @-@ ce que tu reconnais l&apos; homme sur cette photo ?
je veux me joindre à ton équipe .
ne parlez pas si vite !
j&apos; entends un chat qui gratte à la fenêtre .
il y a une cafétéria à l&apos; université .
je ne savais pas que tu avais autant de chats .
et qui était l&apos; autre ?
ils disposent d&apos; un lit supplémentaire .
vous devriez faire attention à vous .
soyez bon pour les petits animaux .
je ne pense pas que je pourrais faire ça .
quelque chose ralentit mon ordinateur .

je sais que c&apos; est difficile à comprendre , pour toi .
j&apos; ai enfin trouvé un usage à cette vieillerie .
je veux me réchauffer .
tu dois le faire .
je suis désolée de t&apos; ennuyer mais nous avons un petit problème .
j&apos; admire votre détermination .
ils sont tous allés au restaurant .
je suis certain de pouvoir persuader Tom .
je t&apos; ai dit qu&apos; il allait faire froid ici .
veux @-@ tu parler de quoi que ce soit ?
Tom veut rester célibataire .
j&apos; attends les vacances d&apos; été avec impatience .
je fis un rôti .
est @-@ elle toujours célibataire ?
elle n&apos; est pas aussi belle que sa sœur aînée .
il est riche comme Crésus .
n&apos; éludez pas la question !
pourquoi Tom veut @-@ il cette information ?
que diriez @-@ vous ?
on ouvre à tous ceux qui frappent .
Tom m&apos; a donné un vélo .
Tom a l&apos; air perdu .
il a acheté une douzaine d&apos; œufs .
vous m&apos; avez mal compris .
je ne connais aucun de ses frères .
tu es fort occupé .
elles auront des discussions demain .

Maria ne soupçonnait pas que &quot; Tom &quot; , son correspondant , avec lequel elle correspondait depuis des mois par Internet et dont elle était secrètement amoureuse sans l&apos; avoir jamais rencontré , était juste un écureuil surdoué .
je suis encore à l&apos; école .
comment as @-@ tu pu me faire ça ?
la troisième puissance de 3 est 27 .
comment vous êtes @-@ vous intéressé à l&apos; art ?
les chiens ne mordent que rarement , sauf s&apos; ils sont attaqués .
c&apos; est quelque chose que ma sœur n&apos; a jamais eu envie de faire .
Tom a maintenu qu&apos; il était innocent .
c&apos; est un homme friand de cérémonie .
si seulement tu y avais réfléchi avant de te vanter .
il a très peur des chiens .
je vous ferai savoir quand c&apos; est terminé .
cela est d&apos; aspect ordinaire .
tu es pâle comme un fantôme .
à plus tard !
je ne veux vraiment pas en parler .
pouvez @-@ vous aider à s&apos; occuper des enfants ?
la philosophie est considérée comme difficile .
la radio ne fonctionne pas .
il est mort depuis cinq ans .
je savais que nous aurions dû essayer d&apos; aider Tom .
Reconsidérons le problème !

nous ne nous attendions pas à ce qu&apos; il termine le travail en si peu de temps .
la barre d&apos; espace est une touche de clavier alphanumérique .
il m&apos; est impossible de faire ce travail .
il y a beaucoup de sucre dans cette boîte noire .
notre mère n&apos; avait pas d&apos; autre choix que de faire à dîner avec les restes .

lorsque j&apos; étais à New @-@ York , j&apos; ai rencontré un vieil ami .
je veux présenter mes excuses pour la manière dont j&apos; ai agi hier soir .
puissiez @-@ vous être touchées par Son Appendice Nouillesque .
je n&apos; arrive pas à croire que vous mangez ce que le médecin vous a prescrit de ne pas manger .
oui , mais c&apos; est beaucoup de travail .
elle s&apos; est presque évanouie .
combien pour l&apos; express ?
mon père n&apos; est pas à la maison .
mon livre n&apos; est pas là .
c&apos; est seulement à ce moment que j&apos; ai compris ce qu&apos; il voulait dire .
pourquoi avez @-@ vous acheté une autre voiture ?
où tout le monde s&apos; en est @-@ il allé ?
c&apos; est moi qui ai faux .
Tom gagne beaucoup d&apos; argent .
vous avez beaucoup de téléphones .
Gardez l &quot; œil sur le ballon .
je me suis brûlé la main avec un fer à repasser .
c&apos; est impossible .
on aime sa mère presque sans le savoir , sans le sentir , car cela est naturel comme de vivre .
ça m&apos; a fait peur .
un verre d&apos; eau froide est très rafraîchissant lorsqu&apos; il fait chaud .
pourriez @-@ vous m&apos; indiquer l&apos; arrêt de bus le plus proche ?

Tom est un maître de plongée .
j&apos; apprendrai l&apos; allemand .
puis @-@ je aller au lit maintenant ?
je peux t&apos; apprendre quelque chose .
c&apos; est impardonnable de fréquenter un gueux pareil , ma chérie !
tu me vois désolé de ne pas pouvoir être présent à tes côtés dans cette douloureuse épreuve .
regarde ce bordel .
il est tout sauf un homme fiable .
Tom ne peut sûrement pas faire ça aussi bien que moi .
le sucre est soluble dans l&apos; eau .
que penses @-@ tu de la nouvelle robe de Mary ?
j&apos; ai beaucoup de problèmes .
il ne suffit pas d&apos; apprendre des formules par cœur . vous devez savoir comment les utiliser .
qu&apos; est @-@ ce qu&apos; une belle femme comme vous fait dans un endroit pareil ?
qu&apos; espériez @-@ vous qu&apos; il advienne ?
peut @-@ être as @-@ tu raison , après tout .
Marie parle couramment l&apos; allemand , mais avec un léger accent américain .
elle attend toujours de moi que je l&apos; aide .
Adressez @-@ vous à mon collègue .
je veux vraiment vous voir .

je suis arrivé au sommet à 5 heures précises .
c&apos; était un vrai miracle .
quelle est votre destination finale ?
il était une fois un pauvre homme et une femme riche .
qu&apos; allez @-@ vous faire ce soir ?
un comptable enregistre toutes les rentrées et toutes les dépenses de l&apos; entreprise chaque semaine .
j&apos; y suis allé aussi .
j&apos; ignore pourquoi je m&apos; en soucie même encore .
il détient une vidéo .
je suis une femme , au cas où vous vous poseriez la question .
je préférerais le faire seul .
je peux recommander ce restaurant .
l&apos; employé fut escorté hors des locaux .
Tom et seulement Tom peut le faire .
pourquoi ne commencez @-@ vous pas par nous dire qui est allé avec vous ?
Kate a eu l&apos; occasion de jouer un rôle important dans un film .
je suis reconnaissante pour ce que tu as fait hier .
montre @-@ nous le droit chemin .
il fit ce que je lui dis de faire .
peux @-@ tu aller au bureau en train ?
l&apos; instituteur fut étonné par ma réponse .
nous avons rénové une maison .
qui vous a enseigné le français ?
vous êtes la plus jolie femme que j&apos; ai jamais vue .
je ne peux pas vous aider car je suis occupé .
vivement que Tom rentre à la maison , que je puisse lui montrer ça .
sors du lit !
elles l&apos; ont détruit .
il travaille sous mes ordres .
il faut que tu le voies .
si quelqu&apos; un sait quelque chose , s&apos; il vous plaît faites le moi savoir .
il y a beaucoup de parcs dans notre ville .
tu dois me l&apos; enseigner , un de ces jours .
il n&apos; y a rien comme une bière froide quand il fait chaud .
dites à Tom ce que vous voulez dire .
malheureusement , j&apos; ai déjà quelque chose de prévu ce jour @-@ là .
es @-@ tu sûr que nous avons assez de bière ?
la ville entière a été dévastée par l&apos; eau .
j&apos; ai des amis , en veux @-@ tu en voilà .
Excusez @-@ moi , mais je pense que c&apos; est ma place .

ça serait une bonne idée .
ça serait le pied !
j&apos; ai vu un saoulard gisant sur la route .
je ne suis pas vraiment d&apos; humeur à lire .
je n&apos; ai pas eu beaucoup de temps .
tout devient de plus en plus compliqué .
tous les jours vous devriez au moins écouter une courte chanson , lire un bon poème , admirer une belle image , et , si possible , prononcer quelques mots intelligents .
c&apos; est vraiment trop .
je dus quitter Varsovie et gagner mon pain en quelque autre lieu .
Babylone était célèbre pour ses jardins suspendus .
je ne peux être vue avec toi .
l&apos; ennemi a largué beaucoup de bombes sur l&apos; usine .
je suis là tout le temps .

n&apos; oublie pas d&apos; apporter les ustensiles de cuisine comme les couteaux ou les casseroles .

cela ressemble à l&apos; effet d&apos; un virus .
nique ta mère , chienne .
qui ne se satisfait pas de peu ne se satisfait de rien .
pourquoi n&apos; essaies @-@ tu pas une autre piste ?
ça fait quelque temps que je veux te poser une question .
pourquoi ne pas simplement frapper à la porte ?
en France , où il a été fondé , Tatoeba est devenu un phénomène social et culturel .
je parle kurmandji .
