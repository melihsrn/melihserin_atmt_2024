W@@ i@@ pe your tears .
it took me more than two hours to translate a few p@@ ages of English .
it@@ &apos; s getting harder for me to concentrate .
I@@ &apos; m not cre@@ ative .
the books were so val@@ u@@ able that they were hand@@ led with the greatest care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong tree .
I have questions .

I had a headache , so I coul@@ d@@ n&apos; t do that .
it@@ &apos; s ahead of schedule .
Tom rarely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she di@@ d@@ n&apos; t want him to play po@@ ker .
when we look at other plac@@ es in the universe , it could very well be that photo@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exc@@ eption .
it@@ &apos; s true that it would be easier for students if there were only one single Spanish dial@@ ect , but th@@ at@@ &apos; s quite far from being the case .
I won@@ &apos; t run away like a coward .

Tom wi@@ ped his glasses .
it really h@@ its the n@@ ail on the head .
she has international ren@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom slip and fall .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man@@ &apos; s worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with numb@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I built this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .
Tom coul@@ d@@ n&apos; t go to the concert because he had to work .
he@@ &apos; s broke .
she is far from honest .
there are good gr@@ ounds for the view that Paris was the scene of f@@ requ@@ ent rio@@ ts even before the re@@ volution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef out@@ line of the plan .
if I were you , I would ignore it .
there are four seas@@ ons in this country .
I want a don@@ ut .
I@@ &apos; m incre@@ di@@ bly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver medal .

y@@ ou@@ &apos; re the only one who wants to do that , ar@@ en@@ &apos; t you ?
tell Tom I@@ &apos; ll be there as soon as I can .

last winter , I went ski@@ ing in Canada .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami was@@ n&apos; t in love with Layla .
this sofa can seat three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don@@ &apos; t expect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please prepare for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don@@ &apos; t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don@@ &apos; t see much choice .
I just don@@ &apos; t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or single ? do you live alone or are you in a rel@@ ation@@ ship ?
the sky is clear . not a clou@@ d in sight .
I@@ &apos; m not stopping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing sitting down is not all that bad .

the injured were removed from the scene .

she was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cure for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the result .
do not be shy . your pron@@ un@@ ciation is more or less correct .
the air was hu@@ mi@@ d and lu@@ k@@ e@@ warm .
of course , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day .
she is as flat as a p@@ anc@@ ake .
this article is more interesting than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you hit your children ?
beauty pleas@@ es the eyes , kindness en@@ ch@@ ants the soul .
our plan went wrong from the beginning .
I don@@ &apos; t enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reasons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need tea ?
a child should not get more spending money than is necessary .
the pizza is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am &quot; .
I was surprised by his sudden appearance .
no one could deny this .
Tom ran out of mat@@ ches so he coul@@ d@@ n&apos; t light the fire .

we want to leave .
I@@ &apos; m sorry for repro@@ ach@@ ing you .
does Tom still rely on his parents ?
I don@@ &apos; t believe it happened that way .
I@@ &apos; m no friend of yours .
I just wanted clari@@ fication .
let@@ &apos; s worry about that later .
he hurt his finger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to res@@ cue him .
I figured out a way to make more money .
this job gives me the hum@@ p .
I di@@ d@@ n&apos; t tell you everything .

I@@ &apos; ve got something better in mind .
not all geniuses are engineers , but all engineers are geniuses . the set of all engineers is th@@ us an , unfortunately proper , sub@@ set of all geniuses .
I don@@ &apos; t think anyone thinks y@@ ou@@ &apos; re crazy .
Tom ignored our advice .

his eyes were smiling behind his glasses .

I di@@ d@@ n&apos; t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I@@ &apos; ve been working on this for months .

qu&apos; est @-@ ce que la vie sans le ray@@ onnement de l&apos; amour ?
c&apos; est le lieu in@@ oubli@@ able où nous nous sommes rencontrés pour la première fois .
c&apos; est , je crois , un fait indé@@ ni@@ able que les Américains sont , en tant qu&apos; Américains , le peuple le plus conscient d&apos; eux @-@ mêmes et celui ayant le plus besoin de croire que les autres nations for@@ ment un compl@@ ot vis@@ ant à les dé@@ préci@@ er .

le lait est ai@@ g@@ re .
quiconque parle @-@ t @-@ il anglais ?
il a fait appe@@ l à nous pour avoir de l&apos; aide .
pourquoi m&apos; as @-@ tu laissé dormir si tard ?
il est peut @-@ être impossible d&apos; ob@@ tenir un Cor@@ pus complètement dénu@@ é de fautes , étant donnée la nature de ce type d&apos; entreprise collabor@@ ative . C@@ ep@@ endant , si nous encourag@@ eons les mem@@ bres à produire des phrases dans leurs propres langues plutôt que d&apos; expéri@@ men@@ ter dans les langues qu&apos; ils appr@@ ennent , nous pour@@ rions être en mesure de rédu@@ ire les erreurs .
c&apos; est la pire chose que tu puis@@ ses faire !
a @-@ t @-@ il de l&apos; expérience en ag@@ ri@@ culture ?

il est temps de s&apos; él@@ ever et de res@@ pl@@ en@@ di@@ r .
il l&apos; a fait quand même .
le salaire est mis@@ ér@@ able et les heures sont longues .

je ne peux le faire seul . j&apos; ai besoin de ton aide .
je ne suis pas d&apos; accord avec la théorie selon laquelle on doit apprendre le latin pour mieux comprendre l&apos; anglais .
je suis sérieux !
vous seule pouvez le faire , mais vous ne pouvez le faire seule .
vous ne voulez pas le savoir .
en quoi pensez @-@ vous que ceci soit fait ?
je dois poser quelques questions .
j&apos; ai besoin de preuves .
Tom ne chante pas très bien .

l&apos; hiver dernier je suis allé sk@@ ier au Canada .
je voulais vous parler à propos de quelque chose .
il a dit qu&apos; il avait beaucoup d&apos; argent .
Sami n&apos; était pas amoureux de Layla .
trois personnes peuvent facilement s&apos; asseoir dans ce canapé .

Sami a eu une dure journée .

le chien est @-@ il en train de nager ?
P@@ répare @-@ toi pour le voyage , je te prie .
je pense que Tom est un joli nom .
je ne sais pas qui a fait ça .
je note tout ; je me sens mal à l&apos; aise sans mon car@@ net .
ça clari@@ fie les choses .
tu es bon .
je ne vois guère de choix .
je ne veux tout simplement pas vous voir être blessée .
êtes @-@ vous marié ou célibataire ? vivez @-@ vous seul ou en couple ?

nous avons toujours assez de temps , si nous l&apos; utilis@@ ons correctement .

ça m&apos; a presque fait peur de ne pas te voir conn@@ ec@@ tée pendant toute une journée .
elle n&apos; a pas de poi@@ tr@@ ine .
cet article est plus intéressant que le pré@@ cé@@ dent .
Fr@@ app@@ ez @-@ vous vos enfants ?
la beauté plaît aux yeux , la douc@@ eur char@@ me l&apos; âme .
notre plan s&apos; est mal gou@@ p@@ illé dès le départ .
je n&apos; aime pas apprendre aux enfants à nager quand leurs parents sont à côté .
c&apos; est l&apos; une des raisons pour lesquelles j&apos; adore Tatoeba .
as @-@ tu encore besoin de thé ?
un enfant ne devrait pas recev@@ oir plus d&apos; argent de poche qu&apos; il n&apos; est nécessaire .
la pizza est froide .
&quot; êtes @-@ vous enseignant ? &quot; &quot; oui , je le suis &quot; .

nous voulons partir .
je regrette de vous faire des repro@@ ches .
Tom dépend @-@ il encore de ses parents ?
je ne crois pas que ce soit arrivé de cette manière .
je ne compte pas au nombre de tes amis .
je voulais simplement une clari@@ fication .
Sou@@ ci@@ ons @-@ nous de cela plus tard .
il s&apos; est fait mal au doigt avec une ai@@ gu@@ ille .

un guide fit faire le tour du musée aux touristes .
ce problème est difficile à résoudre .

ta sœur a appelé .
ils nous ont vues alors qu&apos; ils étaient en train de desc@@ endre du train .
il veut écras@@ er la bes@@ ti@@ ole .
je comprends tes sentiments .
je ne connaissais pas du tout cette femme .
de temps à autre , ta sœur demande aux n@@ ô@@ tres de lui enseigner quelque chose .
je ne veux pas que mon fils soit comme toi .
c&apos; est la répétition qui t&apos; aide à te souvenir de quelque chose .
quand ton nouveau roman sera @-@ t @-@ il publié ?
pourquoi avez @-@ vous accep@@ té de les aider ?

elle lui expliqu@@ a pourquoi elle n&apos; aimait pas ses parents .
Tom est ici .
je déteste le fromage de ch@@ èvre .

j&apos; ai trouvé l&apos; argent .
il est clair qu&apos; elle veut partir .
vous êtes des lav@@ ettes !
espèce de vieille merde . tes commentaires arrog@@ ants ne sont pas seulement in@@ utiles , mais également chi@@ ants .

je n&apos; arrive pas à croire que je sois là .
tenez @-@ vous prêtes !
je pense qu&apos; ils nous suiv@@ ront .
je vous suis reconnaissante pour votre assist@@ ance .
Tom s&apos; était présenté .
pour l&apos; instant je m&apos; entraî@@ ne seulement .
il re@@ vin@@ t chez lui pour la première fois en dix ans .
cela te dérange @-@ t @-@ il si je fume ?
elle a une leçon de piano une fois par semaine .
il va sans dire que fumer est mauvais pour la santé .
le train fut retar@@ dé à cause des importantes chu@@ tes de neige .
je les déteste toutes .
il fait extrêmement beau aujourd&apos; hui .
je vous dois la vie .
Marie est meilleure nag@@ euse que Jane .
vas @-@ tu vraiment laisser Tom faire ça ?
il n&apos; a pas l&apos; air heureux de nous voir .
franchement , je n&apos; aime pas votre idée .
Tom doit apprendre le français .
Marie a soif .
personne ne l&apos; a invitée .
je sais quelque chose que vous ne savez pas .

la st@@ abilité de l&apos; économie chinoise est considér@@ ab@@ lement ex@@ ag@@ ér@@ ée .
je me sent@@ is mal au sujet de ce que j&apos; avais fait .
tu cap@@ tes ?

je suis ici avec une amie .
voulez @-@ vous me faire croire ça ?
Tom avait peur de l&apos; échec .
j&apos; ai mer@@ dé .
A@@ ï@@ e !
elle aurait dû être très fière de vous .
depuis que je me suis cassé le pied , je marche avec des bé@@ qu@@ illes .
cette idée ne m&apos; est jamais passée par la tête .
je n&apos; y comprends rien du tout .
je suis très surpris de vous voir ici .
Tom n&apos; a pas suffisamment d&apos; argent pour acheter une voiture .
je n&apos; aime pas le café .
le R@@ h@@ in s&apos; étend entre la France et l&apos; Allemagne .
ils sont allés à la piscine publique .
j&apos; ai dit que c&apos; était une salle de conférence , pas une chambre à coucher !
la Terre est une grosse bou@@ le .
c&apos; est mon tour de te raconter un secret .
que fais @-@ tu , papa ?
vous vivez dans le passé .
où vous êtes @-@ vous rend@@ ues , exactement ?
pourquoi est @-@ ce que je ne parviens pas à te voir ?
je les ai@@ mais bien .
je suis heureux d&apos; avoir cette occasion de parler avec vous .
rien ne semblait sortir de l&apos; ordinaire .
l&apos; avez @-@ vous réellement vu ?
je dois m&apos; acheter un nouveau manteau d&apos; hiver .
je sais que tu ne fais qu&apos; essayer de donner un coup de main et je t&apos; en suis reconnaissante .
la ré@@ volution ne sera pas so@@ bre .
dois @-@ je prendre ce médic@@ ament ?
avant de traverser une rue , regarde d&apos; abord à gauche , puis à droite , et de nouveau à gauche .

je te cherche partout .
je t&apos; en prie .
tu nous manques beaucoup .
Sami était riche en ter@@ res .
une équipe par@@ amé@@ dic@@ ale se tient prête .
ils m&apos; ont hon@@ or@@ é à l&apos; occasion de mon anniversaire .
pensez simplement à ce que vous ress@@ enti@@ riez en par@@ eille situation !

Tom b@@ ég@@ aie .
Tom a causé tout un tas d&apos; ennuis .
c&apos; est produit par ordinateur .

combien de gens peuvent tenir dans votre voiture ?
les écureuils mangent des gl@@ ands .

Tom et Marie sont un du@@ o musical .
je ne comprends pas pourquoi les gens croient aux fantômes .
les pe@@ ines peuvent nous apprendre beaucoup de choses . et beaucoup plus que les mots .
j&apos; ai réussi à avoir se que je voulais .
c&apos; est ce que j&apos; espère .
ça compte .
quel genre de tatou@@ ages voulez @-@ vous ?
il réfu@@ ta la rumeur .
j&apos; ai six bou@@ ches à nour@@ rir .
ne mange pas comme un por@@ c .
tu es la plus belle femme qu&apos; il m&apos; ait été donné de voir .
enlève cette chose de moi !
rien ne vaut son chez @-@ soi .
Tom est facile à vivre , n&apos; est @-@ ce pas ?
je suis sûre que c&apos; est juste un mal@@ entendu .
je suppose que vous voulez me demander où j&apos; ai été .
c&apos; est lui qui a cassé la fenêtre hier .
C@@ ou@@ rez aussi vite que vous pouvez et ne me l@@ â@@ chez pas la main !
quand pensais @-@ tu revenir aux USA ?
le pauvre vie@@ illard était rédu@@ it à l&apos; état de s@@ quel@@ ette .
où est mon téléphone ?
Tom ne pourrait pas faire une telle chose .
ce bébé ressemble à sa mère .
j&apos; ai eu la tentation de me faire porter pâle .
la vie no@@ c@@ tur@@ ne est meilleure à New @-@ York .
tu nous as tra@@ his .
Tom ren@@ dit Mary heureuse .

ils frapp@@ èrent à la porte et dirent qu&apos; ils étaient venus pour l&apos; arrêter .
j&apos; ai attendu pendant une heure , mais il n&apos; est pas appar@@ u .
je me lev@@ ai pendant qu&apos; il faisait encore noir .
que re@@ présente ce tableau ?
le psy@@ cho@@ lo@@ gue m&apos; a posé toute une bat@@ terie de questions .
elle a quitté l&apos; hôpital il y a une heure .
je l&apos; ai attendu toute la journée .
ça a été son seul espoir .
je me suis arrêté à l&apos; épic@@ erie et j&apos; ai acheté du lait sur le chemin du retour .
sois gentille !
il est simplement doué pour la musique . il a maîtri@@ sé la guitare en une année à l&apos; âge de 15 ans .

il y en a quelques @-@ unes à moi .
il y a une école au pied de la montagne .
Promettez @-@ moi que vous ne fer@@ ez plus ça !

vous devez immédiatement voir un médecin .
A@@ jou@@ tez la may@@ onn@@ aise .

comme il ne pouvait en supporter plus , il prit ses jambes à son cou .
le jury n&apos; a pas cru au réc@@ it de Dan .

personne ne peut t&apos; entendre là .
la porte était déjà ouverte .
j&apos; aime comment Tom fait ça .
avez @-@ vous des frères et sœurs ?
&quot; Marie , le café est trop fort pour moi &quot; . - &quot; Oh , je suis désolée . prends peut @-@ être un peu de lait &quot; .
il a donné un discours dans lequel il a soutenu mon opinion .
j&apos; ignor@@ ais ce que je trouver@@ ais .
Tom ne s&apos; est pas encore rendu compte de son erreur .
si tu vas dans ce supermarché , tu pour@@ ras acheter la plupart des objets que tu uti@@ li@@ ses dans ta vie quotidienne .
Re@@ pos@@ ons @-@ nous un peu .
il n&apos; y avait absolument rien que vous puissiez y faire .
aimes @-@ tu les films d&apos; horreur ?

as @-@ tu quelques conseils pour moi ?
Je@@ anne n&apos; est pas aussi grande que Marie .
où habite John ?
j&apos; ai regardé aux alent@@ ours et ai const@@ até que j&apos; étais la seule voiture sur la route .
je trouve que c&apos; est la meilleure réponse .
Quels aliments , s&apos; il y en a , évit@@ ez @-@ vous de manger ?

nous devrions tout simplement prof@@ iter de cela et ne pas vous soucier de combien il en coûte .
c&apos; est un beau mec .
je vous ai demandé en premier .
elle se trouve juste derrière toi .
le résul@@ tat était plutôt déc@@ evant .

ce n&apos; est pas une sain@@ te .
j&apos; ai rêv@@ é que j&apos; avais été en@@ lev@@ ée par des extr@@ at@@ er@@ res@@ tres .
j&apos; en crois pas mes yeux .
Tom refus@@ era de le faire .
elle le pous@@ sa de la jet@@ ée .

je lui ai acheté une nouvelle voiture .
elles ont dé@@ b@@ allé leurs sandwi@@ ch@@ s .
finalement il a été possible de trouver une solution vraiment satis@@ fai@@ s@@ ante .
il n&apos; avait pas l&apos; air heureux .
je me met@@ tr@@ ai à la place du mort .
j&apos; ai un copain qui m&apos; aime .
santé vaut mieux que rich@@ esse , des deux ce dernier est celui qui rapporte le moins .
votre demande a été refus@@ ée car vous ne disposez pas d&apos; une adresse résidenti@@ elle vali@@ de .

il est toujours en avance d&apos; un temps ou deux sur l&apos; époque .
je ne peux pas la voir .
en voici l&apos; adresse .
je n&apos; ai pas très envie de discuter .
les deux voitures sont entr@@ ées en colli@@ sion à l&apos; inter@@ section .

Tom a dit qu&apos; il avait des choses plus importantes à faire .
B@@ re@@ and@@ an est avocat .
en quoi Tom est @-@ il doué ?
tout était difficile .
personne ne lit mon journal électronique .
quand il s&apos; en aper@@ c@@ ev@@ ra , il sera trop tard .
comment l&apos; avez @-@ vous perdue ?
elle l&apos; appel@@ a un jour sur deux .
il fut en retard à cause de la neige .
elle a dit qu&apos; elle avait été heureuse .
combien de temps ceci va @-@ t @-@ il continuer ?
je pense que nous sommes à égalité .
j&apos; ai fait de mon mieux .
mon médecin pense que c&apos; est canc@@ é@@ reux , mais m&apos; a dit que je pouvais prendre un deuxième avis .
le bureau des dou@@ an@@ es se trouve à la frontière .
nous nous rel@@ ay@@ âmes pour conduire .
que s&apos; est @-@ il passé hier soir ?
celui qui voudrait améliorer sa condition devrait exam@@ iner son fond@@ ement .
le contrat a été conclu .
s&apos; il te plaît , arrête .

le diam@@ ant semble auth@@ enti@@ que .
tu veux voir ?
j&apos; ai déjà dit oui .
comment vont mes petits cop@@ ains ?
mes affaires sont prêtes et je suis prêt à y aller .
ma copine a dit que ce n&apos; était qu&apos; une sépar@@ ation tem@@ por@@ aire .
le t@@ ét@@ an@@ os tue encore !
l&apos; amour de la liberté nous a am@@ en@@ és ici .
Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! pas de sou@@ c@@ is ! j&apos; ai eu l&apos; au@@ d@@ ace de blu@@ ff@@ er .
je l&apos; ai trouvé .
une liberté qui ne s&apos; emplo@@ ie qu&apos; à nier la liberté doit être ni@@ ée .
donne @-@ lui un jour ou deux .
ne vous app@@ es@@ anti@@ ss@@ ez pas trop sur le sujet .
personne ne peut nous contr@@ ô@@ ler .
je ne voulais pas t&apos; insul@@ ter .
où se trouve sa maison ?
il n&apos; avait pas d&apos; ami pour l&apos; aider .
l&apos; homme n&apos; est jamais ni parfait , ni content .
nous étions par@@ ten@@ aires .
je vois un ciel bleu clair , et je me sens si bien .
Tom est plus vieux que moi .
je suis indi@@ gnée !
à plus .
ça lui prendra du temps de se remettre de ses bles@@ sures .
je vais devoir confis@@ quer ton couteau .
elle s&apos; inquiète de la santé de son père .
viend@@ rais @-@ tu avec nous ?
tu es timide , n&apos; est @-@ ce pas ?
il fau@@ dra que tu pr@@ ennes sa place , au cas où il ne puisse venir .
il vous a tra@@ hi .
Tom aime l&apos; ari@@ th@@ mé@@ tique .
je n&apos; avais pas idée que ce br@@ ac@@ el@@ et fut volé .
si chaque génération meu@@ rt et laisse des fantômes , le monde fin@@ ira par en être sur@@ peu@@ pl@@ é .
personne ici ne te tra@@ hi@@ ra .
j&apos; étais exig@@ e@@ ante .
cet enfant a résolu facilement ce problème mathé@@ matique compliqué .
Tom a dit à Mary qu&apos; il avait à lui parler .
en moyenne , les J@@ apon@@ aises se mari@@ ent à 2@@ 5 ans .

Tom avait tous les droits d&apos; être fâché .
il a peint le plafond en bleu .
la réunion sera termin@@ ée lorsque nous arriver@@ ons sur place .
il se mit au lit .

Jouons aux jeux vidéo ou à d&apos; autres choses .

Thomas glis@@ sa ses mains dans son dos pour dégr@@ af@@ er son soutien @-@ gorge .
il a rel@@ u mon man@@ us@@ crit .

Vo@@ yons si ça fonctionne !
