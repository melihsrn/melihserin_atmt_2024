Researchers at the university of Paderborn have established that it took up to 2000 hours of English learning for a French speaker to speak English correctly . Given that there are 32 weeks of classes in a year and with 3 hours of lessons every week , 20.83 years of study are thus necessary for a French person to speak good English .
