who is the man s@@ it@@ ting in the cor@@ ner ?
my parents h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly ever p@@ un@@ is@@ h@@ ed me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don s@@ hi@@ p .
the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al we dis@@ ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ed of his o@@ bli@@ g@@ ations .
I had no i@@ de@@ a Tom would do that .
his le@@ gs are long .
Mary was lu@@ c@@ k@@ y to find her k@@ ey@@ s .
it be@@ g@@ an to s@@ now .
why are you do@@ ing that today ?
who were you tal@@ king to ?
this is a pres@@ ent for you .
what &apos;s the f@@ un in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may cho@@ ose wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever you want .
I never tal@@ ked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this con@@ cer@@ t was a@@ w@@ es@@ o@@ me .
what is life with@@ out the ra@@ di@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ g@@ et@@ t@@ able place where we m@@ et ea@@ ch other for the fir@@ st time .
it is , I think , an in@@ dis@@ pu@@ t@@ able fac@@ t that A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans are , as A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans , the most self @-@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous people in the wor@@ ld , and the most ad@@ dic@@ ted to the beli@@ e@@ f that the other n@@ ations of the ear@@ th are in a con@@ sp@@ ir@@ ac@@ y to under@@ v@@ al@@ ue them .
we &apos;re su@@ n@@ k .
do not under@@ es@@ ti@@ m@@ ate my po@@ w@@ er .

I b@@ et you &apos;re right .
have some co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ du@@ c@@ ated people .
the wri@@ ter does not always pres@@ ent life as it is .
langu@@ age and cu@@ l@@ ture can &apos;t be se@@ par@@ ated .
no@@ body car@@ es for me .
there is a ta@@ x@@ i st@@ and n@@ ear the st@@ ation .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ a@@ tr@@ a &apos;s no@@ se had been sh@@ or@@ ter , the hi@@ st@@ ory of the wor@@ ld would be diff@@ er@@ ent .
his room was sm@@ all but c@@ le@@ an , and the fo@@ od was good .
his sle@@ ev@@ e tou@@ ch@@ ed the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a s@@ ac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you under@@ st@@ and ?

are you ready for the tri@@ p ?
you need to be more car@@ e@@ ful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ st@@ er your pro@@ du@@ c@@ t ?
D@@ an had to dec@@ i@@ de wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up s@@ mo@@ king , as it is un@@ he@@ al@@ th@@ y .
there is a tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ion in my room .
