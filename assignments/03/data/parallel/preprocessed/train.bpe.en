I &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ating .
I can &apos;t remember where I par@@ ked the car .
whatever you do , don &apos;t s@@ mile .

English is my favorite sub@@ ject in high school .
it would be better if you work this afternoon .
if for some reason that should happen , what would you do ?
Sami slept in his tent .
the restaurant we went to wasn &apos;t as expensive as I expected it to be .
they appointed him as a direc@@ tor .
almost everything has been im@@ pro@@ ved .
I really like this one .
we found one large foot@@ prin@@ t and a couple of different size sm@@ aller foot@@ prin@@ ts .
do you plan to buy that car ?
does that make any sense ?
they were taken pri@@ son@@ er .

I &apos;d prefer to die rather than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like mat@@ h .
she advised him to talk about his life in the United States .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be fine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any doub@@ ts , do you ?
Tom burst out laughing .
I can not aff@@ or@@ d to buy a used car .
we caught him red @-@ hand@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am as@@ king you for patience .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ plac@@ ement for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was hit by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same decision I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
I have a large bed@@ room .
let the cat out .
I finally met her .
I &apos;ll go wh@@ er@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of complain@@ ts about the way Tom be@@ hav@@ es .
we &apos;re not invited .
you need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to dis@@ play only the l@@ ines with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; inside .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t th@@ row the ball near the windows .
the Earth is like a ball with a large mag@@ net inside .
that &apos;s just what I needed .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want fur@@ ther information .
I could hardly end@@ ure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful but@@ ter@@ fly .
French was the language of diplom@@ acy .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your h@@ our@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a Fren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his accent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grandfather have many si@@ bl@@ ings , there are a lot of kids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fruit .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ re@@ gu@@ lar con@@ jug@@ ation in all languages .
do you want me to re@@ pe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a m@@ ere building .
have you already eaten ?
it &apos;s really aw@@ es@@ ome .
he always takes L@@ รฉ@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true w@@ arri@@ or .
Tom needs lots of courage and pers@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a fortune .
thank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is silent and w@@ ag@@ s its tai@@ l .
what did you just say ?
they make a great team .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding .

he said he was poor .
she thinks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this dr@@ aw@@ ing took me five minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your rules .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re was@@ ting time .
what did you get hit with ?
cars are expensive .
they were not impressed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his permission .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we go@@ tt@@ a have all the d@@ ata in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expensive engag@@ ement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is twice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the date yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my shoes on .
Tom is an archit@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the w@@ arri@@ or .
you are not the only one responsible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to travel with only one su@@ it@@ case .
you &apos;re was@@ ting both of our time .
early ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ers used the stars for n@@ av@@ ig@@ ation .

Tom wants to marry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?

long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
let &apos;s walk a little faster .
I know exactly where I am .
my mom bought me this to@@ y when I was eight years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a hu@@ ge mistake .
breakfast is served .
this is il@@ leg@@ al .
I &apos;m not in the mo@@ od to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without saying go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ?
we man@@ aged to swim across the river .
Mary wants to bre@@ as@@ t@@ fe@@ ed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cure for lon@@ el@@ iness ?
would you mind speaking more s@@ low@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom poin@@ ted out my mistake .
the pa@@ tro@@ l@@ man mo@@ tion@@ ed me to pu@@ ll over .
I &apos;ll send you a post@@ card .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the law .
she has no less than ten children .
all that g@@ list@@ ers is not go@@ ld .
one of the gu@@ ards is dead .
you owe it to yourself to do it .
parents must pro@@ vide their children with pro@@ per food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are supposed to o@@ be@@ y the law .
whatever you do , don &apos;t p@@ ush that butt@@ on .
I love the out@@ fit you &apos;re wearing .
are you accus@@ ing me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t drive now . you &apos;ve been drinking .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t res@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s OK .
follow your heart , for it never lies .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in America , wrote us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the contr@@ act is in the bag , so let &apos;s go out and cele@@ br@@ ate .
according to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have n@@ ine lives .
he was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to Spain on ho@@ li@@ day .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether he should do that or not .
this broken vase cannot be re@@ pai@@ red .
we must have fai@@ th in the pres@@ ident .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to l@@ ess@@ en the imp@@ act of the er@@ r@@ ati@@ c sup@@ p@@ lies .
he has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
do whatever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
we cannot ru@@ le out the possibili@@ ty that ci@@ v@@ il war will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl answ@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w sal@@ ad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .

he &apos;s very poli@@ te .
pick@@ po@@ ckets may oper@@ ate in this area .
this hat is too small . please show me another one .
they forgot to lo@@ ck the door .
speaking English isn &apos;t easy , but interesting .
we need to remember that .
we must talk her out of this fo@@ o@@ lis@@ h plan .
yes , as far as I know .
I was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing .
it &apos;s cold outside .
please be@@ at the eggs .
I know it &apos;s un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic to expect Tom to do that .
a wh@@ ale is a mam@@ mal .
I wrote down his phone number on a s@@ cr@@ ap of paper .
I hope it &apos;s not just a curi@@ os@@ ity .
I can &apos;t imagine my life without Tom .
in@@ spi@@ red by her tea@@ chers , P@@ har@@ amp is going to start her sol@@ ar car@@ eer tomorrow .

I &apos;m super hungry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those problems .
it &apos;s my faul@@ t !
if the situation doesn &apos;t im@@ prove , I &apos;ll be oblig@@ ed to take m@@ ea@@ sures .
I have an umbrella in my car .
whose shoes are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ ef .
do you know where he went ?
the b@@ ear is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ case to your room , sir .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door needs another coat of pain@@ t .
I told you so !
he always went fishing on the river when he was young .
he has three sons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to im@@ prove your Spanish , you shouldn &apos;t have come to C@@ hi@@ le .
I know you like to travel .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the moun@@ t@@ ains and to the sea .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he av@@ eng@@ ed the mur@@ der of his father .
my watch lo@@ ses ten minutes a day .
he is completely bes@@ ot@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air condi@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was f@@ al@@ sel@@ y accused .
he didn &apos;t know how to ex@@ press himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a hea@@ d@@ ache , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ head of s@@ che@@ du@@ le .
Tom rar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ ker .
when we look at other plac@@ es in the universe , it could very well be that photo@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exc@@ ep@@ tion .
it &apos;s true that it would be eas@@ ier for students if there were only one single Spanish di@@ al@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the case .
I won &apos;t run away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice seriously .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday afternoon .
I haven &apos;t told the kids yet that we &apos;re getting divor@@ ced .
let me carry it for you .
I prefer to write in French .
he failed the entr@@ ance ex@@ am .
someone was here .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a shower now .
the house clo@@ s@@ est to here is two mil@@ es away .
her age qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ es her for the job .
he acted like a lun@@ ati@@ c .
they can &apos;t do that .
are you listening ?
I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ris@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dictionary .
if I &apos;d only taken your advice !
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
Sami thinks he did very well in the ex@@ am .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my plea@@ sures is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .
were there any stars in the sky ?
Tom apologi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is growing th@@ ick@@ er .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
I &apos;m a lucky man .
Ear@@ ning our custom@@ ers confi@@ dence and respect is this fir@@ m &apos;s objec@@ tive .
what will the neigh@@ b@@ ors think ?
you can &apos;t prove a thing .
this school sup@@ p@@ lies students with tex@@ t@@ books .
his del@@ ay of coming here on time is due to a traffic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
Japan has a lot of tr@@ ade with Can@@ ada .
shut the window to pre@@ vent cat@@ ching a cold .
it &apos;s dangerous here .
Tom took a day off .
the D@@ ead S@@ ea lies bel@@ o@@ w sea lev@@ el .
Mary &apos;s favorite movie is T@@ he P@@ r@@ in@@ c@@ ess B@@ ride .
the situation is under con@@ trol .
I miss you already .
when did you become a teacher ?
they are my friends .
you might as well go kill yourself .
we play a sport .
he isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I &apos;m just looking out for myself .
he l@@ ac@@ ks t@@ act .
we were concer@@ ned .
A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice wel@@ d b@@ ead is not with@@ in everyone &apos;s reach !
it was not a complete vic@@ t@@ ory .
we el@@ ected Tom cap@@ tain of the team .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
funny !
I can &apos;t do that .
she hand@@ ed me a post@@ card .
I just have to do something .
nobody insul@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was fav@@ orable .
how many col@@ ours are there ?
the language of friend@@ ship is not words but me@@ an@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .
I spent a week with a P@@ al@@ es@@ tin@@ ian family from G@@ az@@ a .
we &apos;re working to fix this bu@@ g .
let me congratul@@ ate you on your engag@@ ement .
a t@@ sun@@ ami is coming , so please be on the al@@ ert .
why did you tell him that ?
Tom was aw@@ fully bo@@ red .
the nu@@ ll hypoth@@ es@@ is st@@ ates how often a s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing er@@ ror alone will produ@@ ce resul@@ ts that are different than a fo@@ rec@@ ast .
at the party there was food in ab@@ un@@ dance .
I want you to speak fran@@ k@@ ly .
they are seeing their uncle tomorrow .
I &apos;m on the inter@@ st@@ ate .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I figured I might find you here .
Tom r@@ ushed past me .
news of her death caus@@ ed great concer@@ n th@@ rou@@ gh@@ out the country .
Tom is bit@@ ing his n@@ ails .
how many of you are there now ?
I &apos;m smar@@ ter than you .
you &apos;re very nice .
I couldn &apos;t enter because the door was closed .
the new tunnel will lin@@ k Bri@@ tain and France .
inst@@ ead of going to school , he stayed at home .
I wish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed .
I must br@@ ush up my English .
it is in the restaurant where Dan e@@ ats lunch .
they g@@ ang@@ ed up on him .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
Tom rum@@ mag@@ ed through the dr@@ aw@@ er , looking for a pen@@ c@@ il .
do you need a ride home later ?
I took the little girl by the hand .
my father sp@@ ends a lot of time on his ho@@ b@@ by .
you che@@ ated .
do you know how to play the piano ?
I wanted to make sure you were all right .
you &apos;ve found it .
I don &apos;t understand your res@@ ist@@ ance .
Mon@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
the weather today is worse than yesterday .
I plan to have lunch with him .
she is wat@@ ering the flowers .
I think Tom e@@ ats too much me@@ at .
what direction are you going ?
I wish there were a French transl@@ ation of this book .
down came the rain in tor@@ ren@@ ts .
she tried to com@@ fort him , but he kept crying .
that won &apos;t change anything .
the most was@@ ted day of all is that on which we have not laughed .
the way tou@@ ri@@ sts dress off@@ ends lo@@ cal stand@@ ards of pro@@ pri@@ ety .
we can &apos;t give up .
it &apos;s a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ standing .
they want someone to help them .
I &apos;m too tired to ar@@ gue .
that lies outside my area of study .
my uncle has a house in Ital@@ y .
she turned down my off@@ er .
Tom has three boys and a girl .
my boyfriend looks like your girlfriend .
Tom was in the shower .
we &apos;ll meet at my house .
you &apos;re the teacher .
we &apos;ve lost fai@@ th in hu@@ man@@ ity .
you must &apos;ve thought I was an idiot .
did he forget his money again ?
look out for rock sli@@ des .
the boy caught a large fish .
don &apos;t forget to post the letter .
the plan@@ e accident cost the lives of 2@@ 00 people .
I have lived in Tokyo since 19@@ 8@@ 5 .
she was a bri@@ des@@ m@@ aid at the wedding .
how do I know that you &apos;re not going to do that again ?
she goes out almost every night .
she &apos;s very tal@@ ented .
come wh@@ en@@ ever it is con@@ ven@@ ient to you .
the s@@ cand@@ al was f@@ at@@ al to his politi@@ cal future .
it &apos;s not easy to understand his ide@@ as .
please accept my sin@@ cer@@ est con@@ do@@ l@@ ences .
he works for an ad@@ verti@@ sing ag@@ enc@@ y .
rest here for a bit .
I had never seen a more beautiful sight .
a b@@ y@@ stand@@ er vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed the police be@@ ating using their c@@ ell phone .
I had trouble fall@@ ing asleep last night .
Tom &apos;s grandfather knew my grandfather .
she wr@@ in@@ k@@ led her bro@@ ws .
unfortunately he refused to come .
am I on the wrong road ?
the earthqu@@ ake sm@@ as@@ hed everything .
I speak H@@ un@@ gar@@ ian .
I spr@@ ang out of bed .
those are your options .
I knew that was Tom .
Tom has lived here since 20@@ 0@@ 3 .
I am coun@@ ting on you to d@@ eli@@ ver the open@@ ing address .
she walked s@@ low@@ ly for fear she should sli@@ p .
stop fil@@ ming .
you &apos;re one of my best friends .
do it this way .
if you &apos;re not happy with the money , give it to me . I will be happy .
they were soldi@@ ers .
brown is not her natural hair co@@ lor .
hasn &apos;t Tom arrived yet ?
when are you going to get married ?
what &apos;s wrong with those ?
Tom bl@@ ushed back .
Tom thinks Mary is ug@@ ly .
they ar@@ gue a lot .
none of you should leave this room .
Tom works in ad@@ verti@@ sing .
a woman &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th is in her ton@@ gue .
clothes are behind me .
some of the photos have been taken at the ris@@ k of life .
that box is heavy .
where were you born ?
it was very different from what I had imagin@@ ed .
do you have everything ?
the reason is clear .
he said the truth .
a man of sense would be ashamed to do so .
he is not too poor to buy a bicycle .
Tom can &apos;t help .
you &apos;re lo@@ sing .
it is best that we speak with a speci@@ alis@@ t .
the 2@@ 6@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber is the Euro@@ pe@@ an D@@ ay of L@@ ang@@ u@@ ages . the C@@ oun@@ c@@ il of Europe wants to dra@@ w attention to the mul@@ ti@@ lin@@ gu@@ al her@@ it@@ age of Europe , to fo@@ st@@ er the ev@@ o@@ lution of mul@@ ti@@ lin@@ gu@@ alis@@ m in soci@@ ety and to en@@ courage ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens to learn languages โ โ . Tatoeba , as an easy @-@ to @-@ use learning to@@ ol and an active commun@@ ity , prom@@ o@@ tes the study and appreci@@ ation of languages in a very practi@@ cal way .
lo@@ ck the door .
the l@@ ack of ev@@ id@@ ence to the contr@@ ary is it@@ self ev@@ id@@ ence that your theory is probably right .
people once believ@@ ed the world was fl@@ at .
don &apos;t p@@ ush me very hard . it &apos;s dangerous .
bring a lunch .
I &apos;ll be with you fore@@ ver .
I go to work .
where &apos;s the key ?
I &apos;m very hungry .
you have cute eyes .
you &apos;re reading .
I am sorry .
remember to ren@@ ew your pass@@ port .
I don &apos;t have a ticket .
I &apos;d like to come home now .
she demand@@ ed to see the manager .
is he at home ?
the next day , at sup@@ per@@ time , I was introdu@@ ced to her husband .
that &apos;s how it is .
how many people are there in your family ?
someone turned the al@@ ar@@ m off .
do you believe that there &apos;s life after death ?
I had a promise to keep .
aren &apos;t you hungry ?
mine is not so good as yours .
let &apos;s eat a wat@@ er@@ mel@@ on !
please tell me how you plan to do that .
the strange obj@@ ect in the sky could be seen with the un@@ ai@@ ded eye .
Tom is cl@@ aus@@ tr@@ op@@ ho@@ bi@@ c .
our anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors came to this country 1@@ 50 years ago .
I have never sun@@ g , and never will sing , in a k@@ ar@@ a@@ o@@ ke bar .
the gen@@ ie is out of the bottle .
H@@ on@@ es@@ tly , Tom , I can &apos;t remember . it was more than 10 years ago .
who is born to be hang@@ ed will never be dro@@ w@@ ned .
how do you know I &apos;m not the one who did it ?
he wouldn &apos;t even look at me .
I &apos;d like to get started right away .
I &apos;m thirty .
commun@@ is@@ m will never be re@@ ach@@ ed in my li@@ fe@@ time .
the sun will become a red gi@@ ant in about 5 b@@ illi@@ on years .
I figured it out by myself .
there is a world of difference between , &quot; some@@ how being understood &quot; and &quot; using correct English . &quot;
I assu@@ me that &apos;s a jo@@ ke .
Euro@@ pe@@ ans drink , on aver@@ age , 1@@ 2@@ .@@ 5 li@@ ters of pu@@ re al@@ co@@ ho@@ l per year .
if you &apos;re going to apologize , you should do it right away .
the bu@@ ll@@ et found its mar@@ k .
I &apos;m starting to get used to the food here .
I &apos;m not going to force you to do that .
he id@@ les away his time .
it didn &apos;t not work .
there is an old cas@@ t@@ le at the fo@@ ot of the mountain .
you told me that you were tired .
if the spec@@ tat@@ ors made fun of the other team , then it would wea@@ ken their mor@@ ale .
I &apos;m press@@ ing char@@ ges .

we will im@@ pl@@ ement a re@@ considered N@@ or@@ th @-@ S@@ ou@@ th co@@ oper@@ ation me@@ chan@@ is@@ m .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to spend her summer vacation .
I didn &apos;t realize you were awake .
shut up , you &apos;re dis@@ tr@@ ac@@ ting me .
you don &apos;t live in a country ; you live in a language . your hom@@ el@@ and , that &apos;s that and nothing else .
I will wait here until he comes back .
why aren &apos;t you studying ?
I can &apos;t make it to your party next weekend .
where &apos;s everybody else ?
the lo@@ a@@ f is small .
we try to explain things across cul@@ tures ; in sp@@ ite of b@@ oun@@ dar@@ ies .
they bur@@ ned .
I &apos;ve lost my religi@@ ous fai@@ th .
did you talk about me ?
you must not go out at night .
all I want is your cat .
we began on a new project .
I have to leave on Monday .
I want to be more than friends .
I don &apos;t know how to cont@@ act you .
your com@@ ic books are on the sh@@ el@@ f .

I thought you were injured .
I want to see more .

I just couldn &apos;t help myself .
clou@@ ds bl@@ ac@@ ken the sky ( and everyone &apos;s mo@@ od ) .
could you please shar@@ pen these kni@@ ves ?
my father might be at home now .
the man was no better than a hor@@ se .
you spend too much time with her .
I have no fun@@ ds in the b@@ ank .
that &apos;s kind of v@@ ague .
you started crying .
I feel bad for them .
I thought you wanted a divor@@ ce .
there &apos;s no need for you to pre@@ p@@ are a for@@ mal speech .
you are ho@@ p@@ eless !
where did you go to school ?
I also like you .
we &apos;ve just cle@@ an@@ ed the toil@@ ets .
I &apos;m travel@@ ing light .
I know Tom &apos;s not happy there .
they hun@@ g their co@@ ats behind the door .
Christ@@ op@@ her Co@@ lum@@ bus once cut himself with a knife . it made him so angry that he then cut the knife ... with himself .
did anyone see you on the beach ?
everyone did it .
it is impossible for him to do it .
she used to wash her hair before going to school .
I &apos;ve already seen the film .
she kept her eyes closed .
you &apos;re not allowed in here .
Tom no@@ d@@ ded quickly .
I need money in gener@@ al , not just now .
we didn &apos;t see her any@@ where .
this is for you .
at last , the end @-@ of @-@ ter@@ m exam@@ s are over .

Tom only drin@@ ks water .
where do you get off telling me that ?
get fu@@ cked in the ass !
children are fon@@ d of cake .
you really do have a beautiful vo@@ ice .
I &apos;ll never forgive you .
that &apos;s very good .
he hurried so he wouldn &apos;t miss the train .
you &apos;re not thinking c@@ lear@@ ly .
he is far from being honest .
have you ever sh@@ a@@ ken with cold ?
I &apos;m glad you called .
we &apos;re doing all we can .
how about having a bar@@ be@@ cue party next Sunday ?
you &apos;re double @-@ par@@ ked .
oranges are swe@@ eter than l@@ em@@ ons .

you really lu@@ cked out on this one .
I take a vacation this week .
I have work to do .
you won &apos;t find a dog bi@@ g@@ ger than this one .
I met her at a dinner party .
W@@ ho@@ ever wants it may take it .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
you &apos;re just a co@@ ward .
painting is another thing I can do fai@@ r@@ ly well .
D@@ is@@ ti@@ ll@@ ed water has no t@@ as@@ te .
there are two cats sleeping on the bed .

I &apos;m on cru@@ t@@ ches for the next month .
I cannot stop the ble@@ e@@ ding .
he is always trying to do the impossible .

I &apos;ve decided to do the same thing .
he dev@@ el@@ op@@ ed his own theory .
how are you doing ? I haven &apos;t seen you in ages !
I boo@@ k@@ mar@@ ked this we@@ b@@ site .

Tom went to sleep three hours ago .
she was talking all the time .
there are s@@ even days in a week .
what &apos;s that tall building ?
are those your daugh@@ ters ?
I don &apos;t want to miss my train .
I don &apos;t want to take a walk now .
we don &apos;t know what they want to use it for .

he is pleased with his work .
it began to rain before I got home .

what did you want to show us ?
don &apos;t try to be a her@@ o .
in his face !
I &apos;m one of you .
I don &apos;t want to be any more bur@@ d@@ en to my parents .
are you out of your mind ?
I &apos;m inside .
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
the only thing that matters is that you weren &apos;t injured .
his be@@ hav@@ i@@ or is very od@@ d today .
milk does not keep long in hot weather .
I like cas@@ t@@ les .
a to@@ oth@@ ache de@@ pri@@ ved me of sleep .
I &apos;ve decided .
I am free this evening .
Tom doesn &apos;t understand the rules .
I wanted to thank you for what you did today .
rab@@ b@@ its are rel@@ ated to be@@ av@@ ers and squir@@ rel@@ s .
we broke up .
you &apos;re very good .
s@@ ave up so that you can go to col@@ le@@ ge .
if Tom and Mary are going to the zoo with you , I &apos;ll go , too .
he told me his life &apos;s story .
Tom has just finished eating dinner .
I need to know everything that you know about Tom .
not all tea@@ chers be@@ have like that .
I think it will be sun@@ ny tomorrow .
yes , I think you ought to go .
go to bed !
I &apos;ve got a fl@@ as@@ h@@ light in the g@@ love com@@ part@@ ment .
yes , my child .
he ex@@ plain@@ ed the politi@@ cal back@@ ground of the war on TV .
we played ch@@ ess .
Sami decided to turn a bl@@ ind eye to the truth .
Tom had a difficult job .
that has nothing to do with it .
would you like to try it again ?
life is too short , really !
he failed to come yesterday .
Tom wants to be a diplom@@ at .
he went there , never to return .
I confis@@ c@@ ated it .
I don &apos;t want to tell him .
what kind of mistakes did you make ?
I wasn &apos;t the one driving the car .
Tom pat@@ ted me on the back and congratul@@ ated me .
P@@ eter was an al@@ tru@@ is@@ tic video game play@@ er ; he would give it@@ ems to people who needed them , rather than sel@@ ling them for person@@ al prof@@ it .
that cat is brown .
it &apos;s not poli@@ te to st@@ are at others .
she went with him to the zoo .
he was s@@ col@@ ded by his teacher for being lazy .
I know that it is high@@ ly un@@ likely that we &apos;ll see any wh@@ ales today .
if I have any more questions , where can I find you ?
it is about time you married .
the milk &apos;s a bit off .
my husband is in j@@ ail .
if I knew his address , I would get in touch with him right away .
Tom found something .
I had an umbrella with me but my friend did not .
I can &apos;t fix the seat .
he igno@@ red her advice .
there was something off in Sami &apos;s life .
you will be paid according to your abili@@ ty .
do you have much snow in your country ?
you look a little gre@@ en around the g@@ ills .
the doctor has no office hours on Monday morning .
he is not in .
we have a break from 10 : 4@@ 0 to 11 : 00 .
I &apos;m leaving in ten minutes .
I de@@ e@@ ply appreciate your advice and kin@@ dness .
I heard someone sh@@ ou@@ ting .
he only works during the day .
Mary said that she &apos;d be late .
make up your mind already ! whether you go in or go out , just stop open@@ ing this door !
you won &apos;t escap@@ e me .
he is flu@@ ent in Chinese .
I was exp@@ ec@@ ting you at 11 : 00 a.@@ m .
give me a ring if you find out anything .
having been busy all day yesterday , I feel very tired this morning .
what do you think they &apos;ll do ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for class on the first day .
sentences past this I@@ D are sentences ad@@ ded by contribu@@ t@@ ors of Tatoeba Pro@@ ject .
he will soon be able to swim well .
when he asked who had broken the window , all the boys put on an air of inno@@ c@@ ence .
did you miss me ?
that &apos;s the har@@ d@@ est part .
I don &apos;t know for certain .
what time do you turn off the li@@ ghts ?
I have to say I en@@ v@@ y you .
his trou@@ bles are not over .
I &apos;m not sure what it was , but it s@@ oun@@ ded like a g@@ un@@ shot .
we have a d@@ ea@@ d@@ line .
is there somewhere in Europe you &apos;d like to visit ?
he &apos;s a bi@@ got .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
he saw in her eyes that she still loved him and hope ar@@ ose inside him .
I don &apos;t even know how old Tom is .
I s@@ lic@@ ed the sandwich di@@ ag@@ on@@ ally .
she should have kept her mou@@ th shut .
I think love does not exist .
I guess my luck just ran out .
he plays bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball best of us all .
the decision is still not de@@ fin@@ ite .
it seems she is over thirty years old .
is your father a doctor ?
I &apos;ve asked you re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly to do that .
the music c@@ arried me back to my childhood .
for dinner , we went back to my place .
I had to go back .
nobody sup@@ por@@ ted my country .
I &apos;ll tell her where I went .
I just did it .
who are you sel@@ ling your car to ?
she speaks English as if she were a n@@ ative spea@@ ker .
I never thought I &apos;d be this busy .
I don &apos;t like both of you going to such a place .
Tom doesn &apos;t know where Mary wants to live .
I &apos;m not happy with my looks .
I had to work over@@ time yesterday .
it &apos;ll be us three : you , me , and An@@ ne .
they accused him of telling a lie .
I &apos;m sorry if I s@@ n@@ apped at you .
you don &apos;t have to get up so early .
last week five students were absent from class .
Sami sp@@ illed his drink in the store .
you don &apos;t have what it takes to be a lea@@ der .
I don &apos;t like feeling so po@@ wer@@ less .
nothing makes Tom happy .
Tom was late for dinner .
I am glad that the matter was s@@ et@@ t@@ led am@@ ic@@ ab@@ ly .
you &apos;re s@@ lo@@ sh@@ ed .
do you have anything to say to us ?
we passed by the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ acy before coming home .
I &apos;ll see you tomorrow at the library .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .
she is , in a word , a dream@@ er .
they des@@ pi@@ se him .
let me join your cause .
prices have dro@@ pped rec@@ ently .
I like to study Spanish .
I &apos;m trying to figure out what you do for fun .
in this case , let &apos;s go .
six times three is ei@@ gh@@ teen .
I don &apos;t know where I am exactly .
not only is se@@ x a safe acti@@ v@@ ity but it is also re@@ comm@@ ended against de@@ pres@@ sion , and contr@@ ary to other physi@@ cal acti@@ vi@@ ties , food or even video games , you can &apos;t have too much of it .
so , why are you here ?
&quot; this is ch@@ ea@@ per than a new hat , &quot; Susan answ@@ ered .
come off it .
close your eyes , please .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you that on the phone .
I eat fruit and drink water .
I didn &apos;t want to get out of bed .
I started the fire .
in the store , they bought the nec@@ es@@ si@@ ties and the super@@ flu@@ ous .
let &apos;s keep an eye on this .
I bet you &apos;re talking about Tom .
I &apos;m sure , in the dist@@ ant future , you won &apos;t be able to forgive yourself .
perhaps the weather is fine .
there are four main cau@@ ses of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l @-@ rel@@ ated death . inju@@ ry from car acci@@ dents or viol@@ ence is one . di@@ seas@@ es like cir@@ r@@ ho@@ sis of the liv@@ er , cancer , heart and blood sy@@ stem di@@ seas@@ es are the others .
do you sub@@ s@@ cri@@ be to any magaz@@ ines ?
I feel the same way as you do .
she can sing and dance beauti@@ fully .
I &apos;ll p@@ ack .
a man sh@@ ou@@ ted something , w@@ av@@ ing his hand .
this is a house and that is a mo@@ s@@ que .
my book has to be somewhere in the room .
we &apos;ll be working on that this week .
I walked to school .
the best is often the enemy of the good .
how could I not see this coming ?
just give me your name and address .
after three drin@@ ks , the man passed out .
she married a lo@@ cal boy .
I wanted to marry him .
how may I help you ?
Sami was land @-@ rich and cas@@ h @-@ poor .
don &apos;t be shy .
I can &apos;t stand it anymore .
you &apos;re going to be late again .
sorry , the f@@ light is already full .
Tom is a cr@@ ane oper@@ ator .
have you become in@@ san@@ e ?
I want to know more about the accident that killed Tom .
Tom cre@@ ated a new fol@@ der on his computer .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s husband .
we s@@ prin@@ k@@ le sal@@ t for pu@@ ri@@ fication .
sit down , Tom .
this animal is just working for re@@ war@@ ds .
next time .
he &apos;s not always happy .
I d@@ anced all night long .
I hate flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent li@@ ghts .
don &apos;t get so exc@@ ited !
does that surprise you ?
I want everything .
what a nu@@ is@@ ance that child is !
we knew they plac@@ ed it here .
get your ass in there .
there &apos;s no point ar@@ gu@@ ing about what &apos;s true and what &apos;s f@@ al@@ se .
I like vac@@ ations .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to go home .
the child s@@ at on his mother &apos;s la@@ p and list@@ ened to the story .
I &apos;ve never done har@@ m to anyone .
she lives in a g@@ ated commun@@ ity .
all are interested in Japan .
what &apos;s your favorite po@@ e@@ m ?
you &apos;re was@@ ting both of our time .
don &apos;t look down on others .
don &apos;t lose heart now .
I know it was very difficult .
he speaks in his sleep .
show me everything .
don &apos;t ask me for money .
Tom and Mary often play car@@ ds together .
I &apos;m not as fast as Tom .
I got exp@@ el@@ led .
what are you going to do with my picture ?
Al@@ low me to introdu@@ ce M@@ ay@@ u@@ ko to you .
find yourself a dec@@ ent suit .
he is a smart little guy .
he had a wh@@ ale of a time .
you &apos;re in@@ corri@@ gi@@ ble .
man is so made that when anything fir@@ es his soul , im@@ possibili@@ ties van@@ ish !
he star@@ ed into the distance .
why don &apos;t you ride with me ?
they are all very hungry .
I went to N@@ ag@@ as@@ ak@@ i .
Sami opened a second com@@ ic boo@@ k@@ store in C@@ air@@ o .
I think that you have my umbrella .
my children like school .
I can &apos;t help taking pain@@ k@@ ill@@ ers when I have a hea@@ d@@ ache .
I didn &apos;t say it made sense .
he dro@@ w@@ ned while swimming in the river .
can &apos;t you hear all the car hor@@ ns hon@@ king behind us ?
is that yours ?
time will always take re@@ ven@@ ge on those who forget about it .
hurry up or you &apos;ll be late .
they tru@@ sted you .
Tom was ob@@ vi@@ ously dis@@ gu@@ sted .
I want to do that now .
I don &apos;t have a lot of money .
I won &apos;t tell you why I did that .
the man died of cancer .
I have nothing to do with the matter .
w@@ ind the clock .
my cr@@ am school is a long way from here .
you warned me , but I didn &apos;t listen .
she was the val@@ e@@ dic@@ to@@ ri@@ an of her class .
stop being so fu@@ c@@ king re@@ tar@@ ded !
her cooking is am@@ az@@ ing .
the law does not accept conf@@ es@@ sion under tor@@ ture .
Tom loves spor@@ ts ev@@ ents .
I hear tell you &apos;re going to get married .
what exactly did you find ?
we near@@ ly star@@ ved .
I thought you &apos;d be full after eating that big st@@ ea@@ k .
how long have you been doing this ?
you should try it on .
look out ! there &apos;s a tru@@ ck coming !
I thought I knew all your secrets .
we &apos;re kee@@ ping all options open at this point .
his en@@ coun@@ ter with her is en@@ ri@@ ching his in@@ ner life .
do you have a dog ?
is this your umbrella ?
while I was swimming , I got a cr@@ amp in my leg .
I need not have wat@@ ered the flowers . just after I finished it started raining .
you should go now .
my opinion is different from yours .
they &apos;ve reali@@ zed they should stop dis@@ crimin@@ ation against g@@ ays .
the well d@@ eli@@ vers a great deal of o@@ il .
I &apos;m on my way .
I remember seeing her .
who is that boy ?
he didn &apos;t have time to spend with his children .
what choice did I have ?
please don &apos;t l@@ au@@ gh at me .
what a di@@ ck !
it is a small dog .
it is vit@@ al that you be present .
what did they say ?
French is a very beautiful language .
can you imagine ? In@@ de@@ ed , the squ@@ are ro@@ ot of min@@ us one is &apos; i &apos; .
you found me where no one else was looking .
I need a taxi !
what is it you really want to tell me ?
you need to grow up .
my pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion is ready at the ph@@ ar@@ m@@ ac@@ ist &apos;s .
did you know that men who re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly take the bir@@ th con@@ trol p@@ ill don &apos;t get pre@@ gn@@ ant ?
we &apos;ve had no complain@@ ts .
do you miss it ?
don &apos;t worry , I have every angle co@@ vered .
would you consider giving me a small lo@@ an ?
it happen@@ s more often than you would think .
you may choose one of them .
why did you absent yourself from class yesterday ?
he is ho@@ l@@ ding his books under his ar@@ m .
do not drink too much br@@ and@@ y !
don &apos;t talk to me about him .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely sli@@ pped my mind .
I didn &apos;t realize you could speak French .
where did you get that orange scar@@ f ?
the story turned my blood cold .
because there are a lot of vol@@ can@@ o@@ es , it is easy for Japan to be hit by earthqu@@ akes .
I &apos;m looking for people to speak E@@ s@@ per@@ anto with .
I just started crying .
this book is too expensive .
the bill , please .
sh@@ ame be to him who thinks ev@@ il of it .
if you &apos;re sick , hon@@ ey t@@ as@@ tes bit@@ ter .
can I see you at ten tomorrow ?
I read in the newspaper ad@@ verti@@ sem@@ ents that there is an a@@ part@@ ment for rent near here .
Tom certain@@ ly won &apos;t get my vo@@ te .
I didn &apos;t want you to feel you were alone .
I am spe@@ e@@ ch@@ less .
what &apos;s your favorite fl@@ av@@ or of ice cre@@ am ?
everything seems con@@ fus@@ ing .
saf@@ ety is what matters most .
Dan &apos;s story de@@ fied common sense .
is this dress wash @-@ able ?
sooner or later , I &apos;ll probably visit Boston .
Tom drank three bo@@ tt@@ les of wine by himself last night .
I wish there were some hot girls in my class .
the company didn &apos;t immediately respon@@ d to re@@ ques@@ ts for comment .
I enjoy swimming .
how do you say that in French ?
I &apos;d kill for a beer right now .
Tom was wearing a w@@ ire .
who are you tex@@ ting ?
you shouldn &apos;t read in such poor light .
would you like to eat something ?
happy is the man who is content with his lot .
that &apos;s why I asked .
the com@@ ic books were p@@ iled on the des@@ k .
I want to play .
I &apos;m sure Tom was involved .
Tom has a lot of toys .
this is an old building .
do you believe in gho@@ sts ?
am I being accused of mur@@ der ?
I &apos;ve been very busy since the new ter@@ m started .
I &apos;m much older than you are .
when did Tom arrive ?
I can &apos;t wait to meet him .
that &apos;s non@@ sense . nobody but a fo@@ ol would believe it .
Tom is a good b@@ ass play@@ er .
I just can &apos;t figure it out .
if you &apos;d listen , you &apos;d understand .
which one was your favorite ?
you &apos;ll call me , won &apos;t you ?
I learned French in Paris .
I caught a fish !
he never coun@@ ts on my help .
does she always smoke Char@@ les &apos; ci@@ gar@@ ettes ?
mom , could you read me a bed@@ time story ?
what b@@ lis@@ s to be loved ! and to love , ye G@@ ods , what b@@ lis@@ s !
his question pu@@ zz@@ les me .
I don &apos;t feel sorry for you .
you shouldn &apos;t have paid the bill .
I sugg@@ est that you take a n@@ ap .
am I really the only one here who doesn &apos;t understand French ?
why does he have to do that ?
this is the man for you to speak to .
the student missed class three times in a row .
if I had known about your ill@@ ness , I could have visited you in the hospital .
give me a ring if you find out anything .
it &apos;s just not worth it .
why didn &apos;t you just tell the truth ?
don &apos;t touch the flowers .
break the eggs and separ@@ ate the y@@ ol@@ ks and wh@@ ites .
my house is next to the big tree .
I can &apos;t live without my cat .
some say that I@@ s@@ ra@@ el should be boy@@ co@@ t@@ ted for its a@@ par@@ the@@ id sy@@ stem .
last summer I had a chance to visit Lon@@ don .
in No@@ v@@ ember , o@@ lives are har@@ v@@ es@@ ted from the trees to make o@@ il .
I wasn &apos;t hungry .
I suppose you &apos;re already p@@ acked and ready to go .
I had bar@@ ely got into the house when the phone rang .
Tom wasn &apos;t in a good mo@@ od then .
I found the ear@@ ring that you lost .
don &apos;t cut in when others are talking .
it rang .
R@@ ear end col@@ li@@ sions often cause wh@@ i@@ pl@@ as@@ h .
he is tru@@ sted by his parents .
she had ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed her objec@@ tive .
it &apos;s your turn to sh@@ u@@ ff@@ le .
this was the best @-@ sel@@ ling book last week .
we &apos;re comm@@ itted .
everyone needs to stay fo@@ c@@ used .
do you study English ?
Bob re@@ ach@@ ed the finish line first .
I think we were lucky .
this tall man is Mr Smith .
were you fat when you were in high school ?
take my glasses .
I &apos;ve stopped pay@@ ing attention to arrogant , mat@@ er@@ i@@ alis@@ tic and un@@ pleas@@ ant people .
you don &apos;t need a lot .
you &apos;re the teacher .
how much more suff@@ ering can they end@@ ure ?
I don &apos;t want to be late for work .
can you help me write a love letter ?
I haven &apos;t done this since high school .
something is wrong with this cal@@ cul@@ ator .
the story cannot be true .
did you understand what I meant by that ?
please th@@ row me the ball .
I do not like ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs very much .
Americ@@ ans spend most of their lives working , being produc@@ tive .
prices ro@@ se high@@ er and high@@ er .
speak in a lou@@ d vo@@ ice when you give your speech .
she took off her clothes .
the T@@ i@@ me T@@ rav@@ el@@ ler devo@@ ted his attention to his dinner , and dis@@ played the ap@@ petite of a tr@@ amp .
how did you come by this painting ?
how much did they give you for your old car ?
he married a pretty girl .
I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t want to do that .
you only think about having fun .
I cannot make no@@ ise . the baby is sleeping .
how do you deal with it ?
let &apos;s wait an hour .
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day .
I wonder what it could be .
are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I brought you another blan@@ ket .
S@@ am is two years youn@@ ger than Tom .
I met her by chance at a restaurant yesterday .
you are in Boston .
that &apos;s not your problem anymore .
I know that you are busy .
you are a doctor .
will the train leave on time ?
I &apos;m w@@ illing to help you if you want me to .
I don &apos;t know how to des@@ cri@@ be it .
Mary always y@@ ells when she &apos;s angry .
Tom tried to hu@@ la ho@@ o@@ p .
perhaps you are mist@@ a@@ ken .
if the times go against you , then go with the times .
when I en@@ tered the kitchen , she was making chicken cur@@ ry with ri@@ ce .
I am through with my work .
who is the man sit@@ ting in the cor@@ ner ?
my parents hardly ever pun@@ ished me for anything .
we must ab@@ an@@ don ship .
the off@@ ici@@ al we dis@@ char@@ ged of his oblig@@ ations .
I had no idea Tom would do that .
his legs are long .
Mary was lucky to find her keys .
it began to snow .
why are you doing that today ?
who were you talking to ?
this is a present for you .
what &apos;s the fun in this ?
did Tom see that ?
I had a little help from a friend .
you may choose wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever you want .
I never talked to him again .
he &apos;s k@@ ic@@ king me !
this concert was aw@@ es@@ ome .
what is life without the radi@@ ance of love ?
this is the un@@ for@@ get@@ table place where we met each other for the first time .
it is , I think , an in@@ dispu@@ table fact that Americ@@ ans are , as Americ@@ ans , the most self @-@ consci@@ ous people in the world , and the most ad@@ dic@@ ted to the beli@@ ef that the other nations of the earth are in a con@@ spir@@ acy to under@@ val@@ ue them .
we &apos;re sun@@ k .
do not under@@ esti@@ mate my power .
I can &apos;t play tennis as well as I used to .
this is fu@@ cked up .
I bet you &apos;re right .
have some coffee .
unfortunately , they are very po@@ or@@ ly e@@ duc@@ ated people .
the wri@@ ter does not always present life as it is .
language and culture can &apos;t be separ@@ ated .
nobody car@@ es for me .
there is a taxi stand near the station .
if C@@ le@@ op@@ a@@ tra &apos;s no@@ se had been shor@@ ter , the history of the world would be different .
his room was small but clean , and the food was good .
his sle@@ ev@@ e touched the gre@@ as@@ y p@@ an .
it &apos;s a sac@@ red right .
I think Tom can do that .
they are all very happy .
why don &apos;t you understand ?
I have children .
Smith has spent years studying the effec@@ ts of sleep and sleep loss on memory and learning .
I did everything I could do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll have time to do it .
we want to help .
you don &apos;t need to worry anymore .
where is your father ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to get a bit of exercise .
the cat ru@@ ined my sof@@ a .
we &apos;re less than hal@@ f@@ way to the top of the mountain . are you already tired ?
congratul@@ ations !
I &apos;m re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly feeling down in the du@@ m@@ ps .
they &apos;re all on vacation .
if you can , come with us .
I trust Tom &apos;s ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment .
I go home .
I &apos;ve been asked to become the manager .
a crow@@ d was g@@ ath@@ ering around him .
I &apos;ll do it tomorrow .
she died of tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis .
it was your mistake .
it was very rude of you to say a thing like that .
these tex@@ ts were written in H@@ e@@ bre@@ w , not in A@@ ram@@ ai@@ c .
you look familiar . do I know you ?
we must do it again .
she made a tour of America , stop@@ ping in six ci@@ ties .
Mr . young w@@ is@@ h@@ es his son would study har@@ der .
I have no faul@@ ts .
please sign here .
I need a little help here .
you &apos;re going to have to pay for the re@@ pair .
take things as they are .
it is raining now .
you &apos;re too susp@@ icious about everything .
so t@@ as@@ ty !
I &apos;ve never had problems before .
I probably should have said something .
don &apos;t mi@@ x the dish@@ clo@@ ths with the servi@@ ettes .
I thought he would be upset .
I had no idea there were so many people in the other room .
H@@ er@@ o@@ ing is one of the shor@@ test @-@ lived profes@@ sions there is .
the milk is s@@ our .
does anyone speak English ?
he appe@@ al@@ ed to us for help .
why did you let me sleep so late ?
it may be impossible to get a completely er@@ ror @-@ free cor@@ pus due to the nature of this kind of coll@@ abor@@ ative effor@@ t . H@@ ow@@ ever , if we en@@ courage mem@@ b@@ ers to contribu@@ te sentences in their own languages rather than experi@@ ment in languages they are learning , we might be able to minim@@ ize er@@ r@@ ors .
that is the worst thing you can do !
has he got any experience of far@@ ming ?
Tom knows the city very well .
you could &apos;ve ru@@ ined everything .
because they &apos;re watching television .
we &apos;ve just finished breakfast .
write your address here .
that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to do .
he was a w@@ and@@ ering pe@@ dd@@ ler .
Tom wal@@ ks s@@ low@@ ly .
keep practi@@ c@@ ing , Tom .
I &apos;d like to talk to you for a minute .
he already knows that .
all of a su@@ dden , Tom and I were alone .
thanks to you , I spent all my money .
I guess it &apos;s time to go .
if you are to realize your dream , you must work har@@ der .
I hate the tie you &apos;re wearing .
I like this book .
mother no@@ ted that my feet were not clean .
I really loved you .
the girl is I@@ ris@@ h .
please per@@ mit me to ask you some questions .
I was married .
he doesn &apos;t have his medic@@ ation .
each gener@@ ation would have to re@@ disco@@ ver for it@@ self the tru@@ ths of the past .
it goes without saying that hon@@ es@@ ty is the key to success .
time to ri@@ se and sh@@ ine .
he did it any@@ way .
the pay is terrible and the hours are long .
how old is the universe ?
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary everything .
my wife is six months pre@@ gn@@ ant with our first son .
this is hard for me .
they can &apos;t do that .
I miss his kiss .
what are your reasons for practi@@ sing Chinese medicine in the U@@ K ?
the neigh@@ bo@@ r asked us to turn the music down .
I tried to tell you .
I ski@@ pped out on my appoin@@ t@@ ment with my bo@@ ss .
he turned his mind to it .
he was near@@ ly run over at a cros@@ sing .
every country has its own history .
Tom made me read this book .
do I have to sp@@ ell it out for you ?
do you know the movie A@@ v@@ at@@ ar ?
even my bo@@ ss did not congratul@@ ate me .
God hel@@ ps those who help them@@ selves .
which is brown ?
this guy des@@ er@@ ves a me@@ d@@ al .
do you eat it in the class@@ room ?
never tell me a lie again .
do not fe@@ ed the du@@ cks .
he lives in B@@ el@@ fast .
G@@ ir@@ aff@@ es have very long nec@@ ks .
the house is on fire !
I get a three per@@ cent comm@@ is@@ sion on anything I sell .
you will give me this letter .
I wanted to speak with you first .
Tom admitted he had accep@@ ted a bri@@ be .
you can help .
you must pre@@ p@@ are yourself for the worst .
they think I &apos;m a milli@@ on@@ aire .
we mi@@ sto@@ ok him for an Americ@@ an .
we must accept our existence as far as possible .
I believ@@ ed you .
he li@@ ed about his age .
there is something I must know .
the box had been dam@@ aged , but its conten@@ ts were in@@ t@@ act .

would you be w@@ illing to send me a s@@ am@@ ple free of charge ?
French isn &apos;t my n@@ ative language .
we &apos;re all very good play@@ ers .

I &apos;m sick of this .
I want everything to be perfect .
what were you waiting for ?

I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an older woman .
every mo@@ vement is pain@@ ful .

I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese culture and history .
she looked trou@@ bl@@ ed by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me nervous .
do you mind much ?
it is clou@@ dy now .
the show star@@ ts at noon .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very under@@ standing .
French is my favorite language .
I think that she &apos;s hi@@ ding something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .
she thre@@ at@@ ened to set our house on fire .
the wh@@ ale is well known to be the lar@@ g@@ est mam@@ mal .

Sami knows this hood like the back of his hand .
the ris@@ ks are too great .
S@@ te@@ ph@@ en C@@ ol@@ ber@@ t is a pretty crazy guy .
give it back to me .
Mr Smith tea@@ ches me English .
the el@@ ev@@ ator seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time cho@@ o@@ sing whether I should listen to reason or my feelings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to wash my car .
you should get that sof@@ a reu@@ pho@@ l@@ st@@ ered .
the old woman is too wea@@ k to get out of bed .
even if it costs 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 yen , I must buy the dictionary .
he is so old that he cannot walk quickly .
please wait a moment .
pre@@ p@@ are yourself .
they admitted they were scared .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjoy sp@@ ending time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his d@@ and@@ er up .
it &apos;s a fruit .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of eating at the school caf@@ et@@ er@@ ia .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a message ?
how lon@@ ely and hel@@ pl@@ ess she must feel left all by herself !
as the first p@@ ack em@@ erg@@ es , the spec@@ tat@@ ors take pictures with their cam@@ er@@ as and mo@@ bi@@ le phones .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I needed to eat less cand@@ y .
I didn &apos;t s@@ cre@@ am .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can explain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy h@@ ou@@ ses .
it &apos;s in the garage .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a solution .
he &apos;s gone into hi@@ ding .
Mr B@@ ro@@ wn is our fin@@ anci@@ al advis@@ er .
I am an arti@@ st .
you should buy her new toys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .
he &apos;s tri@@ pping b@@ all@@ s .

Ju@@ li@@ an w@@ ears r@@ ound glasses like John L@@ enn@@ on &apos;s .
did you get fi@@ red from your last job ?
I like funny guys .
I usually get up at eight .
there is a big park near my school .

we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it r@@ ains .
is it possible to det@@ er@@ mine the diam@@ eter from the cir@@ cu@@ m@@ fer@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
and on sun@@ ny days all the pi@@ geons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feeling OK ?
Sami res@@ em@@ bles the suspect .
what is your number ?
we believe in a better world .
is she still single ?
I didn &apos;t enjoy the party at all .

we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dark outside .
I can &apos;t read Ar@@ ab@@ ic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they h@@ ated Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t agree with the theory that one should learn L@@ atin in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being serious !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need pro@@ of .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .

we &apos;re doing well .
I don &apos;t know what to do here .
you took my ap@@ petite away .
this is the first time that I &apos;ve eaten in an Ital@@ ian pizz@@ er@@ ia .
no one can den@@ y the fact .
above all things , we must not be sel@@ fish .
I have difficul@@ ty concentr@@ ating .
he is always d@@ wel@@ ling on the plea@@ sures of the past .
I &apos;ll stay involved .
this happened pri@@ or to rec@@ e@@ iv@@ ing your letter .
Tom likes tech@@ no@@ log@@ y .
what do you think he did ?
the pl@@ ant is blue .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the government is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the cur@@ ren@@ cy to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ it@@ ing .
ac@@ id rain is not a natural ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
we should pres@@ erve the beauti@@ es of the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
I can get us there more quickly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ m@@ p@@ et .
I think that fact is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I owe you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
carry these books back to the boo@@ k@@ sh@@ el@@ f .
have a nice trip .
the train is leaving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?
that has nothing to do with this .
is this f@@ ake ?
my father always read@@ s the newspaper before breakfast .
Tom told me he &apos;d already eaten .
I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
she plays the flu@@ te .
they look so cute together .
Tom wi@@ ped his glasses .
it really h@@ its the n@@ ail on the head .
she has internation@@ al ren@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom sli@@ p and fall .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with num@@ b@@ ers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I buil@@ t this do@@ gh@@ ouse by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concert because he had to work .
he &apos;s broke .
she is far from honest .
there are good gr@@ ounds for the view that Paris was the scene of f@@ requ@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ volution of 1@@ 7@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef out@@ line of the plan .
if I were you , I would ignore it .
there are four seas@@ ons in this country .
I want a don@@ ut .
I &apos;m incre@@ di@@ bly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having o@@ dd@@ ly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks worried .
I obj@@ ect to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a sandwich &quot; B@@ u@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory is where we study every day .
I like these h@@ ats .
we &apos;ll dec@@ ide later .
last winter , I went ski@@ ing in Can@@ ada .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
this sof@@ a can seat three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t expect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please pre@@ p@@ are for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or single ? do you live alone or are you in a rel@@ ation@@ ship ?
the sky is clear . not a clou@@ d in sight .
I &apos;m not stop@@ ping you .
P@@ ee@@ ing sit@@ ting down is not all that bad .
check these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it correc@@ tly .
Tom is as tall as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future beg@@ ins today .
I think it &apos;s dangerous for children to swim in this lake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleeping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necessary .
an en@@ orm@@ ous space station ori@@ bit@@ ing around J@@ up@@ iter over@@ looked the rain@@ bo@@ w stri@@ pes of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the injured were re@@ moved from the scene .
the train is arriv@@ ing !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cure for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the resul@@ t .
do not be shy . your pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the air was hu@@ mi@@ d and lu@@ k@@ e@@ warm .
of course , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost scared me not to see you on@@ line for a whole day .
she is as fl@@ at as a p@@ anc@@ ake .
this article is more interesting than the pre@@ vi@@ ous one .
do you hit your children ?
beau@@ ty pleas@@ es the eyes , kin@@ dness en@@ ch@@ ants the soul .
our plan went wrong from the beginning .
I don &apos;t enjoy tea@@ ching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reasons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need tea ?
a child should not get more sp@@ ending money than is necessary .
the pizza is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his su@@ dden appear@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom ran out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a profession@@ al bas@@ eball game .
Tom &apos;s innocent .
everyone g@@ ath@@ ered together for the picture .
I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is je@@ al@@ ous .
please re@@ fer to the tou@@ ri@@ st information office .
don &apos;t leave the front door open .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be coming .
it was N@@ ancy where M@@ a@@ x was supposed to meet P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a .
Tom and Mary was@@ hed the dish@@ es together .
Tom is watching .
bes@@ ides the rain , we experi@@ enc@@ ed heavy win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but we@@ al@@ thy town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
P@@ en@@ ance is one of the s@@ even sac@@ ram@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing you .
does Tom still rely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted cl@@ ari@@ fication .
let &apos;s worry about that later .
he hurt his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ d@@ le .
she did her best to res@@ cue him .
I figured out a way to make more money .
this job gives me the hum@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came true .
I hate people who have feelings .
have a nice weekend !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to re@@ pe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; sto@@ ries . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .
not all geni@@ uses are eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers , but all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers are geni@@ uses . the set of all eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers is th@@ us an , unfortunately pro@@ per , sub@@ set of all geni@@ uses .
I don &apos;t think anyone thinks you &apos;re crazy .
Tom igno@@ red our advice .
we will be done in at most an hour .
I see her laughing and jo@@ king with them .
he was star@@ ing at her c@@ leav@@ age .
we &apos;re finished already .
we &apos;re un@@ rel@@ ated .
it &apos;s mis@@ lea@@ ding .
the only one who can solve this problem is you .
what a beautiful rain@@ bo@@ w !
you &apos;re a nervous w@@ re@@ ck .
are you good at kee@@ ping secrets ?
try hard to hold it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
you don &apos;t sound enti@@ rely convin@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
it &apos;s a quar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the scene of the crime .
it makes no fu@@ c@@ king sense .
his eyes were sm@@ iling behind his glasses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the pres@@ ident &apos;s new secre@@ t@@ ary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
when is something art ?
please make five copies of this do@@ cu@@ ment .
do you have your p@@ ills ?
it s@@ no@@ wed yesterday .
don &apos;t s@@ ass me .
I want to take you to dinner .
I don &apos;t know when the meeting started , but it started at least thirty minutes ago .
it &apos;s not supposed to happen .
he hit me twice .
help me , please .
I &apos;ve never gotten a spe@@ e@@ ding ticket .
I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish lea@@ ped out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more pre@@ ci@@ ous than time .
are there any bag@@ s in this shop ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very rude .
he &apos;s painting his house .
Tom looks like a fore@@ igner .
I had two copies of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go do@@ w@@ n@@ town .
tell me what you did on your ho@@ li@@ days .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicycle .
I &apos;ve learned so much from my mistakes , I &apos;m thinking of making a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes slow .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ for@@ d Uni@@ vers@@ ity .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will snow tomorrow .
you &apos;re too n@@ ai@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ick and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re ashamed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for months .
what year were you born ?
please dro@@ p in when you happen to be in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
he is e@@ ager to please .
I didn &apos;t catch your last name .
we &apos;re both w@@ it@@ n@@ esses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a bat@@ h .
you don &apos;t have permission to do that .
I don &apos;t need any rest .
all took part in the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ations .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the patient was dis@@ char@@ ged from hospital .
do you think Tom can return ?
I have no money to buy the dictionary .
Sami refused to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been studying music in Boston before I re@@ turned to Japan .
she visited the old man in the hospital every day but Sunday .
she came to Japan for the pu@@ r@@ pose of studying Japanese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ duc@@ ted and im@@ pre@@ gn@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who l@@ and@@ ed their fl@@ ying s@@ auc@@ er in my back@@ y@@ ard .
why did God cre@@ ate the universe ?
pass me the sugar , please .
that was cool .
is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
there was a heavy rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I men@@ tion that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having doub@@ ts .
they like English .
listen to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wore a red bl@@ ouse .
I stayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the town was full of acti@@ v@@ ity .
leave him alone .
I had no intention of doing so .
the Earth and S@@ un are just tin@@ y do@@ ts am@@ ong the b@@ illi@@ ons of stars in the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay G@@ al@@ ax@@ y .
I sugg@@ est we go out for a drink .
maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
do you recogni@@ ze the man in this photo ?
I want to join your team .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a caf@@ et@@ er@@ ia in the university .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
and who was the other ?
they have an ex@@ tra bed .
you should take care of your@@ selves .
be kind to little animals .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is s@@ lowing down my computer .
my computer cr@@ as@@ hed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the des@@ ire for le@@ i@@ sure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other urg@@ es , le@@ i@@ sure w@@ ins .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the mountain . are you really already ex@@ hau@@ sted ?
few students can read L@@ atin .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I finally found a use for this old thing .
I want to warm myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bother you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I admire your determin@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can persu@@ ade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay single .
I &apos;m looking forward to summer vacation .
I made a pot ro@@ ast .
is she still single ?
she is not as beautiful as her older sister .
he &apos;s rich as C@@ ro@@ es@@ us .
don &apos;t do@@ dge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ cks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en eggs .
you mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood me .
I don &apos;t know either of his bro@@ th@@ ers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will hold talks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to protect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the wedding be held ? &quot;
only a miracle may get him out of it .
can I see your driver &apos;s license ?
this should solve all your problems .
the man reading a newspaper is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
did you have any luck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ anger here .
someone threw a rock at him .
he kissed me on the fore@@ head .
Mar@@ ia didn &apos;t suspect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her pen @-@ friend , with wh@@ om she had been correspon@@ ding for months over the Internet and wh@@ om she secre@@ tly loved , without ever having met him , was actually a super @-@ intelligent squir@@ rel .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 2@@ 7 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ dom b@@ ites un@@ less it is att@@ acked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom main@@ t@@ ain@@ ed that he was innocent .
he is a man who is fon@@ d of cer@@ em@@ ony .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big mou@@ th off .
he is very afraid of dogs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is ordin@@ ary @-@ looking .
you look pale as a gho@@ st .
catch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the kids ?
philoso@@ ph@@ y is often regar@@ ded as difficult .
the radio doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consider the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time .
the space bar is an alph@@ anu@@ meric@@ al key@@ bo@@ ard &apos;s key .
that job is impossible for me to do .
there is much sugar in this black box .
our mother had no choice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
these two l@@ ines cut across each other at right angles .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dres@@ ses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s smart , hand@@ some and poli@@ te .
don &apos;t put all your eggs in one bas@@ ket .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in New York , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to apologize for the way I acted last night .
may you be touched by H@@ is No@@ o@@ dly Ap@@ pend@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she almost fai@@ n@@ ted .
how much is the ex@@ press ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only then did I realize what he meant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lots of phones .
keep your eye on the ball .
I bur@@ ned my hand with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s impossible .
we love our mother almost without kno@@ wing it , without feeling it , as it is as natural as to live .
it scared me .
when I &apos;m hot , a glass of cool water really re@@ fr@@ es@@ h@@ es me .
can you tell me where the near@@ est bus stop is ?
the st@@ ew sm@@ ells del@@ icious .
Tom talks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; why is your room p@@ in@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m loved .
you still haven &apos;t finished pay@@ ing for your was@@ hing mach@@ ine ?
there is a rock in my sho@@ e .
this dog will protect us .
Tom is a di@@ ve mas@@ ter .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
can I go to bed now ?
I can teach you something .
it &apos;s un@@ for@@ gi@@ v@@ able to date such a broken man , dar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side during this pain@@ ful or@@ deal .
look at this m@@ ess .
he is anything but a reli@@ able man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
sugar is solu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
it &apos;s not enough to mem@@ ori@@ ze the for@@ mul@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you expect to happen ?
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is flu@@ ent in German , but with a s@@ light Americ@@ an accent .
she always exp@@ ec@@ ts me to help her .
go and speak to my col@@ le@@ ague .
I do want to see you .
he was s@@ l@@ ain in batt@@ le .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to bl@@ ame you .
I like cats .
why don &apos;t you use a ham@@ mer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I re@@ ach@@ ed the h@@ ill@@ top exactly at five .
it was tru@@ ly a miracle .
what &apos;s your fin@@ al destination ?
once u@@ pon a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
what are you going to do tonight ?
a boo@@ k@@ kee@@ per com@@ pu@@ tes all the company &apos;s in@@ come and ex@@ penses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
he has a video .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wonder@@ ing .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can re@@ comm@@ end this restaurant .
the emplo@@ y@@ ee was es@@ cor@@ ted off the pre@@ mis@@ es .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
Kate has been given an opportun@@ ity to play a maj@@ or ro@@ le in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
show us the str@@ ai@@ ght p@@ ath .
he did what I told him to do .
can you go to the office by train ?
the teacher was disappointed at my answer .
we ren@@ o@@ v@@ ated a house .
who t@@ au@@ ght you French ?
you &apos;re the pre@@ t@@ ti@@ est woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
get out of bed .
they ru@@ ined it .
he works under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .
there are many par@@ ks in our town .
you must teach me , one of these days .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
tell Tom what you mean .
unfortunately , I already have plans for that day .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
the whole city was dev@@ as@@ t@@ ated by water .
I have plenty of friends .
excuse me , but I think this is my seat .
this is an op@@ ti@@ cal ill@@ usion .
let &apos;s move !
it was a gam@@ ble .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
my wife often r@@ ings me up , while she trav@@ els abroad .
why does Tom have a gun ?
you touched my heart .
they got to be good friends .
excuse me sir , could you tell me where the place of the cin@@ em@@ a loc@@ ated ?
what are you watching ?
what has he done to you ?
ignore him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a drunk l@@ ying on the road .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is be@@ coming more and more comp@@ lic@@ ated .
every day you should at least listen to a short song , read a good po@@ e@@ m , look at a beautiful picture , and , if possible , say several intelligent words .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my living somewhere else .
B@@ ab@@ y@@ l@@ on was famous for its hang@@ ing gard@@ ens .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the enemy dro@@ pped many b@@ om@@ bs on the fac@@ t@@ ory .
I &apos;m here all the time .

I found the love of my life .
do you want to sit next to the window ?
that was probably what influ@@ enc@@ ed their decision .
the Ger@@ m@@ ans have won again .
are there any other options ?
you don &apos;t know that .

I bought this hat when I was in Boston .
I agree with everything you just said .

Tom can swim no more than a st@@ one can .
do we need a P@@ l@@ an B ?
is there something I can do for you ?
I think Tom has been very lucky .
he gave the impression of having much money .
it &apos;s st@@ able because all the ro@@ o@@ ts of this equ@@ ation are ne@@ g@@ ative .

the police caught the th@@ i@@ ef .
C@@ entr@@ al Par@@ k is near where I work .
I don &apos;t need a lo@@ an anymore .
I think that he &apos;s probably not a bad boy .

with animals I wish to live my life ; they &apos;re such great comp@@ an@@ ions !
how did they find out ?
I haven &apos;t seen any of his pictures .

yes , that was am@@ az@@ ing . Un@@ believ@@ able !
what do you want to see while you &apos;re here ?
I wonder if anything happened to him .
I love all of you .
what &apos;s going on down there ?
it is pre@@ mat@@ ure to discus@@ s it now .
no one knows her .
we often hear you sing .
he diff@@ ers from his brother .
when are you going home ?
they w@@ av@@ ed fl@@ ag@@ s to wel@@ come the princ@@ ess .
he was be@@ coming a famous singer .
I quit smoking .
I know that you and Tom are friends .
we were att@@ acked by sw@@ ar@@ ms of be@@ es .
fear is a bad advis@@ er .
it &apos;s a very small price for such an important vic@@ t@@ ory .
Sami didn &apos;t want to be sh@@ am@@ ed in the village by his che@@ ating wife .
Tom isn &apos;t a min@@ or .
Tom took out a bag of mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows .
you know this isn &apos;t the way we should be doing this .
I gave the house to you .
what do you regret most ?
don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t war@@ n you .
the little girl , de@@ e@@ ply moved by the old man &apos;s pi@@ ti@@ ful story , burst into tears .
it depends on how much money you have .
he wants to be a doctor in the future .

the route was blo@@ cked by a tree .
I often played tru@@ ant .
Tom has coll@@ ected a great many but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies .
now sh@@ ake hands and make up .
the S@@ un sm@@ iled through the window every morning .
I was in way over my head .
I have no parti@@ cul@@ ar tal@@ ent .
Tom knew this was going to happen .
guess what I found on the beach .
I &apos;ve spent a lot .
the girl who lives next door is very pretty .
we should have told him the truth .
they are out sho@@ pping .
Tom is determin@@ ed to lose weight .
they are act@@ ors .
I &apos;m looking for someone who can speak P@@ or@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese .
some people say that the theory of ev@@ o@@ lution is &quot; only &quot; a theory but a scientifi@@ c theory is something that has been pro@@ ven to be true .
there &apos;s no so@@ ap .
I felt de@@ pressed .
they spent the afternoon around the pool .
I couldn &apos;t find it any@@ where .
can you show me ?
we &apos;ll take part in the mar@@ ath@@ on .
what &apos;s your di@@ agno@@ sis ?
some@@ day the USA will el@@ ect a woman pres@@ ident , and it won &apos;t be pretty .
if you tell Tom what to do , he &apos;ll do it .
this animal is mine .
it &apos;s A@@ pri@@ l first .
he will soon get used to the cli@@ mate here .
what kind of person am I ?
I admire your ignor@@ ance .
if I s@@ cre@@ w up , what &apos;s the worst that can happen ?
what you did to Tom was cruel .
that rock band gives me a hea@@ d@@ ache .
I can &apos;t forget about that stupid movie .
who gives a fuck ?
no one could den@@ y this .
both he and I are high school students .
c@@ lear@@ ly , this is the most important point .
they &apos;re against animal ab@@ use .
can you sign this birthday card ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to stop al@@ lowing her to always have her own way .
you &apos;re lucky to have such a good job .
I agree with some of your opin@@ ions .
I was already married at your age .
as far as I am concer@@ ned , I have no objec@@ tion .
I just got ten@@ ure .

my dog won &apos;t bite you , un@@ less you ask for it .

I &apos;d tell you all you want and more , if the sounds I made could be what you hear .
take any two car@@ ds you like .
over 3@@ 00 people were ar@@ res@@ ted .
the heart and myst@@ ery of his philoso@@ ph@@ y was , to look u@@ pon the world as a gi@@ gan@@ tic practi@@ cal jo@@ ke ; as something too absur@@ d to be considered seriously , by any r@@ ational man .
the pl@@ as@@ tic sur@@ ge@@ on succeeded in re@@ construc@@ ting the hand of a patient after several long and del@@ ic@@ ate oper@@ ations .
you must exercise more care in writing English .
do you want something to eat ?
you can &apos;t buy that kind of lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty .
they look so cute together .
what can you teach me ?
that won &apos;t change anything .
we &apos;re done .
you need to re@@ dec@@ or@@ ate your room .
I &apos;m sure Tom will leave early .
I know you feel bad .
I have stayed in K@@ yoto for three days .

that is his house .
smoking har@@ ms your health .
where are you going ?
your sister called .
they saw us as they were getting off the train .
he wants to squ@@ ish the bu@@ g .
I understand your feelings .
I didn &apos;t know that woman at all .
now and then your sister as@@ ks our sist@@ ers to teach her something .
I don &apos;t want my son to be like you .
Re@@ peti@@ tion hel@@ ps you remember something .
when will your new novel come out ?
why did you agree to help them ?
why did you do that ?
she ex@@ plain@@ ed to him why she didn &apos;t like his parents .
Tom &apos;s here .
I hate go@@ at che@@ ese .

I found the money .
she c@@ lear@@ ly wants to go .

I fol@@ lowed the reci@@ pe .
things are about to change .
stop del@@ u@@ ding yourself .
we like nobody and nobody likes us .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m here .
be prepared .
I think that they will follow us .
I appreciate your sup@@ port .
Tom introdu@@ ced himself .
I am just war@@ ming up now .
he re@@ turned home for the first time in ten years .
does it bother you if I smoke ?
she has a piano lesson once a week .
it goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health .
the train was del@@ ayed because of heavy s@@ no@@ w@@ fall .
I hate them all .
it is very fine today .
I owe you my life .
Mary is a better swim@@ mer than Jane .
are you really going to let Tom do that ?
he doesn &apos;t look happy to see us .
fran@@ k@@ ly , I don &apos;t like your idea .
Tom must learn French .
Mary is thirsty .
no @-@ one invited her .
I know something you don &apos;t .
are we m@@ ad squir@@ rel@@ s ?
the st@@ abili@@ ty of Chinese e@@ conom@@ y is sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally over@@ esti@@ mat@@ ed .
I felt bad about what I did .
do you get it ?
may I ask you some more questions ?
this mo@@ vement from r@@ ur@@ al to ur@@ b@@ an ar@@ e@@ as has been going on for over two hundred years .
send it to me .
you can &apos;t smoke here .
do you have a blo@@ g ?
I met her late in the evening .
when is the breakfast served ?
I &apos;m here with a friend .
do you want me to believe that ?
Tom was afraid of fai@@ lu@@ re .
I mess@@ ed up .
O@@ w !
she would have been very prou@@ d of you .
I &apos;ve been wal@@ king on cru@@ t@@ ches ever since I broke my fo@@ ot .
this idea has never en@@ tered my head before .
I don &apos;t understand any of this .
I &apos;m very surprised to see you here .
Tom doesn &apos;t have the money to buy a car .
I don &apos;t like coffee .
the R@@ h@@ ine runs between France and Ger@@ many .
they went to the public swimming pool .
I said that this was a meeting room , not a bed@@ room !
the Earth is a big ball .
it &apos;s my turn to tell you a secret .
what are you doing , D@@ ad ?
you &apos;re living in the past .
where exactly did you go ?
why can &apos;t I see you ?
I kind of liked them .
I &apos;m glad to have this opportun@@ ity to speak to you .
nothing se@@ em@@ ed out of the ordin@@ ary .
did you actually see it ?
I must buy a new winter coat .
I know you &apos;re just trying to help , and I appreciate that .
the re@@ volution won &apos;t be so@@ ber .
must I take this medicine ?
before cros@@ sing any street , look first left , then right , and left again .
that &apos;s strange . I could have s@@ wor@@ n that I &apos;d lo@@ cked this door .
I &apos;ve been looking for you every@@ where .
by all means .
we miss you very much .
Sami was we@@ al@@ thy in land .
a team of par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s is standing by .
they hon@@ o@@ red me on my birthday .
just think about how you &apos;d feel in a sim@@ il@@ ar situation .
do you want money ?

squir@@ rel@@ s eat ac@@ or@@ ns .
it &apos;s h@@ ec@@ tic at my place . how about we go back to your place and watch the game there ?
I over@@ slept because I stayed up late .
I like banan@@ as more than ap@@ ples .
he did a pretty good job .
then the do@@ ll &apos;s eyes began to sh@@ ine like two stars and it became alive .
the det@@ ec@@ tive took down his t@@ esti@@ mon@@ y on the spo@@ t .
I think you &apos;re drunk .
we are one , after all , you and I , together we suff@@ er , together exist and fore@@ ver will rec@@ re@@ ate each other .

we all became soldi@@ ers .
I hate these shoes .

Tom and Mary are a mus@@ ical du@@ o .
I don &apos;t understand why people believe in gho@@ sts .
sentences can teach us a lot . and a lot more than just words .
I succeeded in getting what I wanted .
that &apos;s what I hope .
it matters .
what kind of tat@@ too do you want ?
he den@@ i@@ ed the ru@@ mor .
I have six mou@@ ths to fe@@ ed .
don &apos;t eat like a pi@@ g .
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
get that thing off of me .
there &apos;s no place like home .
Tom is eas@@ y@@ going , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a mi@@ sun@@ der@@ standing .
I suppose you want to ask me where I &apos;ve been .
it was him that broke the window yesterday .
run as fast as you can and don &apos;t let go of my hand .
when were you thinking of coming back to the States ?
the poor old man was re@@ du@@ ced to just a sk@@ el@@ et@@ on .
where &apos;s my phone ?
Tom couldn &apos;t do something like that .
the baby takes after his mother .
I was temp@@ ted to call in sick .
the ni@@ gh@@ t@@ life is better in New York .
you have be@@ tr@@ ayed us .
Tom made Mary happy .
I would also take a lot of money .
it &apos;s the ul@@ ti@@ mate test .
Ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing is actually a lot eas@@ ier than it looks .
Mary knows nothing of se@@ wing or k@@ n@@ it@@ ting .
my last name is J@@ ones .

they kno@@ cked on the door and said they had come to ar@@ rest him .
I wai@@ ted for an hour , but he didn &apos;t app@@ ear .
I got up while it was still dark .
what does this painting re@@ present ?
the psy@@ cho@@ log@@ ist asked me a whole bat@@ ter@@ y of questions .
she left the hospital an hour ago .
I wai@@ ted for him all day long .
this was his one and only hope .
I stopped at the store and got some milk on my way back .
be nice .
he is just mus@@ ic@@ ally gi@@ f@@ ted . he mas@@ tered the guit@@ ar in one year at the age of 1@@ 5 .
the sea is very gre@@ en .
do you think something like that will re@@ pe@@ at it@@ self ?
guess whose birthday it is today .
do you love me ?
some of these are mine .
there is a school down the mountain .
promise me you won &apos;t do that again .
who left this m@@ ess in the toil@@ et ?
any clu@@ es ?
he became world @-@ famous for his disco@@ very .
you need to s@@ ave the princ@@ ess .
who won today ?
excuse me . can you direct me to the near@@ est sub@@ way station ?
I list@@ ened to the radio while I worked .
this is your chance .
leave me alone .
I met Bob and Mary while I was waiting for Kate .
Tom escap@@ ed .
can you do a hand@@ stand ?
who does your dec@@ or@@ ating ?
that sounds like a great idea .
I was about to go out when the phone rang .
after what has happened , I d@@ are not see her again .
you &apos;re very busy .
you are to see a doctor at once .
ad@@ d the may@@ onn@@ aise .
Ger@@ many was once al@@ li@@ ed with Ital@@ y .
do your parents know about this ?
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;ll miss her a lot .
I was too tired to care for anything but bed .
he won a go@@ ld me@@ d@@ al .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with you .
both Tom and Mary smoke .
it &apos;s ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
the man is eating bread .
he is of a hu@@ mor@@ ous turn of mind .
A@@ aw@@ w ! he &apos;s so cute .
K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an is one of the dev@@ el@@ op@@ ed countries in C@@ entr@@ al A@@ si@@ a .
I can &apos;t thank you enough for all your kin@@ dness .
he kept his sense of hu@@ mor until the day he died .
I need more paper for my dra@@ win@@ gs .
Tom has two legs .
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow .
I &apos;m trying to remember .
for the time being , I inten@@ d to stay at a hotel .
you should go and have your hair cut .
as usual , he was the last to arrive at the theater .
I know Tom is a good ac@@ tor .
could you please take care of my dog while I &apos;m in Boston ?
do you know how to play ma@@ h@@ j@@ ong ?
I am not a doctor , but a teacher .
I think it &apos;s very likely that they &apos;ll arrive next week .
as he couldn &apos;t end@@ ure , he took to his he@@ els .
the ju@@ ry didn &apos;t buy Dan &apos;s story .
is anyone else going ?
you don &apos;t even know how .
nobody can hear you there .
the door was already open .
I love the way Tom does that .
do you have any bro@@ th@@ ers or sist@@ ers ?
&quot; Mary , the coffee is too strong for me . &quot; &quot; Oh , I am sorry . perhaps ad@@ d a little milk . &quot;
he made a speech in which he sup@@ por@@ ted my opinion .
I didn &apos;t know what I &apos;d find .
Tom hasn &apos;t reali@@ zed his mistake yet .
if you go to that super@@ market , you can buy most things you use in your d@@ ai@@ ly life .
let &apos;s rest a little .
there was absolu@@ tely nothing you could do about it .
do you like hor@@ ror movies ?
whose turn is it ?
do you have any advice for me ?
Jane is not as tall as Mary .
where does John live ?
I looked around and no@@ ti@@ ced that mine was the only car on the road .
I think that &apos;s the best answer .
what foods , if any , do you avoid eating ?
I &apos;m not as busy as Tom .
I don &apos;t know how to do it .
that article makes fun of veget@@ ari@@ ans .
did you take the money ?
Sami recogni@@ zed the man in the photo .
we should just enjoy this and not worry about how much it costs .
he &apos;s a hun@@ k .
I asked you first .
she &apos;s right behind you .
the resul@@ t was rather dis@@ appoin@@ ting .
Tom didn &apos;t come to the last meeting .
by 20@@ 30 tw@@ enty @-@ one per@@ cent of its population will be over si@@ x@@ ty @-@ five .
where did you hear that story ?
I learned how to use a ham@@ mer from my dad .

I haven &apos;t yet done what you &apos;ve asked me to do .
I wash my apple .
he is an acro@@ bat .
your brother is sick .
Tom shouldn &apos;t make fun of Mary .
he did what he promis@@ ed to do for me .
she treated him like a king .
Tom is not crying .
tell us how to solve the problem .
you didn &apos;t make it clear .
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
be mer@@ ci@@ ful .
I spoke to him yesterday .
she &apos;s no s@@ ain@@ t .
I dream@@ ed I had been ab@@ duc@@ ted by ali@@ ens .
I &apos;m in way over my head .
Tom will refu@@ se to do that .
she p@@ ushed him off the pi@@ er .
I don &apos;t expect you to understand it .
give a th@@ i@@ ef enough ro@@ pe and he &apos;ll h@@ ang himself .
I still can &apos;t understand that .
Tom left his tru@@ m@@ p@@ et at school .
he arrived at mi@@ d@@ night .
this looks good .
we went on a pic@@ ni@@ c together .
you &apos;re cre@@ ep@@ y .
Tom often makes the same mistakes .
I hear that Mary is very pretty .
I don &apos;t get it .
I went there times without number .

are there any cute girls in your class ?
it is now that it be@@ comes interesting .
Tom has decided to have the sur@@ ger@@ y that his doctor re@@ comm@@ ended .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
E@@ ri@@ c is on our so@@ c@@ cer team .
when ice mel@@ ts , it be@@ comes li@@ qui@@ d .
Tom was mau@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .
we sw@@ am in the sea .
he slept until ten o &apos;clock .
the Earth is just a little is@@ land and we are little is@@ l@@ and@@ ers .
she is a good li@@ ar .
I am not busy .
why don &apos;t we all go ?
let me put this in per@@ spec@@ tive for you .
nobody des@@ er@@ ves that .
I want to speak to my lawyer now .
can you tell us how that &apos;ll work ?
I love my y@@ el@@ low swe@@ ater .
you shall have a bicycle for your birthday .
she made it plain that she wanted to go to col@@ le@@ ge .
I was a shy child .
I suppose it makes sense to go a@@ head and pay the bill right now .
he is ashamed to ask questions .
I can &apos;t turn it on , because the sw@@ it@@ ch is broken .
these clothes are di@@ r@@ ty and need to be was@@ hed .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll leave early .
they &apos;re reading a book .
Al@@ f@@ red , K@@ ing of En@@ gland , was a great scho@@ lar as well as a great ru@@ ler .
you need to sleep .
&quot; Oh ! they &apos;ll find him guil@@ ty , &quot; said the other . &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of that . &quot;
I am lost .
he is getting better .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
every@@ day life can get a bit mon@@ o@@ ton@@ ous at times .
was V@@ en@@ us , a des@@ ert planet with th@@ ick clou@@ ds of sul@@ fu@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id , fore@@ telling the future of Earth ?
where did you have your suit made ?
I am not certain about that .
while he was sick , he lost a lot of weight .
I &apos;ll bring wine .
do fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ ers cont@@ ain pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us ?
have you already eaten sup@@ per ?
the sun is about to ri@@ se .
it is il@@ leg@@ al to park a car there .
do you know how to read a ma@@ p ?
I thought I had until 2 : 30 .
I like mat@@ h least of all .
that has nothing to do with him .
we call him Mi@@ ke .
how did you get into our room ?
everybody had a hard time .
I &apos;d like some sugar , please .
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to wear glasses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay attention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
he is a true co@@ lo@@ s@@ sus .
I may know someone who can help you .
here we are .
the soci@@ ety in which they live is very different from our own .
she wrote a lot of po@@ ems .
I want to talk to you .
he was born in R@@ ome .
how did you become involved in this project ?
either you or I must go in his place .
with all his faul@@ ts , he is resp@@ ected by everybody .
what a tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy !
Tom hardly ever w@@ ears a tie .
I painted a picture for you .
he likes to talk about himself .
there was a kno@@ ck on the door .
how did you know that man was a co@@ p ?
how did you get into my house ?
I &apos;m not a great photo@@ grap@@ her .
it &apos;s like one of those .
she s@@ cru@@ b@@ bed the kitchen floor with a br@@ ush .
those do@@ ors should be closed .
what would you do in my place ?
I go to any party I am invited to .
there are four seas@@ ons in a year - spring , summer , fall , and winter .
I want to help you get out of this m@@ ess .
Sami was already on the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ as@@ ter .
get mo@@ ving !
I must be leaving now .
she was appreci@@ ab@@ ly t@@ an@@ ned after her vacation .
the wo@@ od was very dark , and she could not help trembl@@ ing from fear .
the g@@ ey@@ ser s@@ ends up a co@@ lum@@ n of hot water every two hours .
the eggs are still hot .
an earthqu@@ ake of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de 5 sho@@ ok Tokyo .
this river runs through my village .
I like hang@@ ing out here .
I want Tom to take a look at that .
do you think he will like that ?
justice in this country is a bit of a double stand@@ ard : there is the justice of the poor and the justice of the rich .
I don &apos;t eat out very often .
&quot; let &apos;s play H@@ o@@ p S@@ k@@ i@@ p An@@ d J@@ um@@ p like me , &quot; said the little white rab@@ bit .
I wonder what all of them have in common .
what was the cause of the explo@@ sion ?
I &apos;ll get my keys .
let me go !
may I introdu@@ ce myself ?
left @-@ hand th@@ read@@ s have now become un@@ su@@ al in me@@ chan@@ ic@@ s but they can still be found on some objec@@ ts , such as on bicy@@ cles &apos; pe@@ d@@ als , for inst@@ ance .
the B@@ B@@ C is my fav@@ ou@@ rite chan@@ nel .
I paid two hundred dollars in tax@@ es .
congratul@@ ations , and thanks for everything !
he t@@ ends to be arrogant .
we remember .
it is free of charge .
will he succ@@ eed or fai@@ l ?
I just don &apos;t like it .
Ju@@ d@@ ging from his appear@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to apologize to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have plenty of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m making an appoin@@ t@@ ment for my daughter .
he succeeded to his uncle &apos;s fortune .
Dan didn &apos;t know where his car key was .
I miss you all the time .
you are a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er .
will you go to the dance with me ?
it &apos;s expensive to mo@@ derni@@ ze a city .
what is the name of that bir@@ d ?
you &apos;re invited .
I &apos;m talking with R@@ oc@@ รญ@@ o .
let me see .
women often pain@@ t their fin@@ ger@@ n@@ ails .
they &apos;re not a thre@@ at .
Tom won &apos;t believe it .
that guy &apos;s a friend of mine .
Australia is about tw@@ enty times lar@@ ger than Japan .
she cut the cake in two .
you hand@@ led that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his success .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I suppose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to sit on the ben@@ ch over there next to the street lam@@ p .
An@@ tar@@ es is a red st@@ ar .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I have a friend in Spain who speaks five languages .
is today your birthday ?
let &apos;s go to Paul &apos;s D@@ iner .
you ought to be quiet in a library .
Tom fell asleep waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only sli@@ gh@@ tly sm@@ aller than the Earth and Mar@@ s is bi@@ g@@ ger than half of Earth .
do you find that was@@ hing mach@@ ine easy to use ?
she comm@@ itted a crime .
I am not in@@ sol@@ ent to@@ war@@ ds them .
it is easy to dist@@ in@@ gu@@ ish good from ev@@ il .
how is your dad ?
bring them to me .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak L@@ o@@ j@@ b@@ an .
Tom drin@@ ks at least three li@@ ters of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the th@@ r@@ ush sings each song twice over .
do you know if he is av@@ ail@@ able ? I need to know in order to make an appoin@@ t@@ ment with him .
don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ v@@ al on price .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Chinese .
have you been told the reasons why we didn &apos;t hi@@ re you ?
do you watch television ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like M@@ os@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s h@@ ell @-@ b@@ ent on fin@@ ding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very comfortable .
the crimin@@ al is sure to do time for rob@@ b@@ ing the store .
my children are hungry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is honest .
her beli@@ ef in God is very fir@@ m .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language refl@@ ec@@ ts d@@ ai@@ ly experience .
Tom began to shi@@ ver viol@@ ently .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he failed .
he should get to your house in an hour .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you forgot to practi@@ ce ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless it is light out .
I didn &apos;t move a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these fo@@ ss@@ ils are the &apos; smoking gun &apos; just before the em@@ erg@@ ence of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gen@@ cy .
how far do we have to go ?
children grow very quickly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that ma@@ them@@ ati@@ cs , being after all a produc@@ t of human thought in@@ de@@ pend@@ ent of experience , is so admi@@ rab@@ ly adap@@ ted to the objec@@ ts of re@@ ality ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .
which co@@ lor do you prefer , blue or gre@@ en ?
the O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c G@@ am@@ es cer@@ em@@ on@@ i@@ ously cele@@ br@@ ate the tri@@ um@@ p@@ h of nation@@ alis@@ m , do@@ ping and commer@@ ce .
in the val@@ le@@ y , the vi@@ o@@ let@@ s came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ land .
her sk@@ in was almost trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is smart .
let us sing a song .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ine logi@@ c is not always log@@ ical .
when we started out , our band could only find small clu@@ bs in small ci@@ ties that would hi@@ re us .
you should respect the rules your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw Layla hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll lend it to you .
I may need to move on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
quit talking , will you ?
they set out for New York .
I des@@ pi@@ se them .
my cat slept next to me .
forgive me .
the floor is co@@ vered with a th@@ ick car@@ p@@ et .
Tom has a small far@@ m not far from Boston .
an animal can be much more dangerous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you drive a sti@@ ck shi@@ ft ?
I go to the the@@ at@@ re .
Dan par@@ ked the r@@ ent@@ al car near the police station .
where do you want to go for our first lesson ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom won@@ dered why Mary had stayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of attr@@ ac@@ ting more Japanese spea@@ kers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ ounds to his ambi@@ tion .
P@@ in@@ ea@@ p@@ ple is rich in cit@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be hear@@ t@@ broken .
how did it come about ?
whose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this movie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lucky to be alive .
you can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the lake , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
giving up smoking is the eas@@ i@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it thous@@ ands of times .
the dog is thirsty .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been prom@@ o@@ ted to the r@@ ank of b@@ is@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c@@ ation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you mean , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fight .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ anger .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mist@@ a@@ ken as@@ sum@@ p@@ tions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she loved her mother de@@ ar@@ ly .
I plea@@ ded not guil@@ ty .
we can &apos;t post@@ po@@ ne the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invited .
long live the ger@@ i@@ o@@ cr@@ acy !
she cannot play the piano .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of me@@ an@@ ness , but rather out of absent @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to str@@ ang@@ ers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ di@@ l@@ ection for be@@ ef .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be crazy to believe such non@@ sense .
I want you to be quiet .
Co@@ tt@@ on ab@@ sor@@ bs water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on Sunday .
you guys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to cook for us ?
what language were they speaking ?
never tell lies .
both altern@@ atives are possible .
maybe I should also ad@@ d sentences without transl@@ ations ? it is a very fast way of im@@ pro@@ ving the popul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to bet on that ?
we made sac@@ ri@@ fic@@ es .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve cho@@ s@@ en her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kiss you the way you want to be kissed .
stop twi@@ sting my ar@@ m !
if he s@@ ends me any letters , I just t@@ ear them up and th@@ row them away .
I was warned .
sooner or later , Tom will likely agree to help us .
this is longer than any other bri@@ dge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher ex@@ plain@@ ing ?
we &apos;d like separ@@ ate ch@@ ec@@ ks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cros@@ sing the bor@@ der .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re warm enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my anc@@ es@@ t@@ ors are . our pap@@ ers got lost during the F@@ lo@@ od .
sit down and shut up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the men@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the super@@ market .
D@@ ro@@ pl@@ ets are fall@@ ing on my lap@@ top computer .
I am sure .
I believe him to be intelligent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a m@@ ember .
this kind of work makes me hungry .
smoking is bad for your health .
In@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f to@@ s@@ sing is an O@@ ly@@ m@@ pi@@ c sport !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your promises .
I just want to be perfect .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great cap@@ ac@@ ity to adap@@ t to envir@@ on@@ ment@@ al chang@@ es .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to America .
I don &apos;t have much inter@@ est in cooking .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your team .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a fight with me ?
his kin@@ dness touched my heart .
he stu@@ di@@ es bi@@ olog@@ y very hard .
my uncle is rich .
to be perfect she l@@ acked just one de@@ f@@ ect .
I hear him fall@@ ing .
you don &apos;t have to be a vic@@ ti@@ m .
which way is the beach ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more ri@@ ce , please ?
don &apos;t talk ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish !
Sami lived very close to the loc@@ ation where Layla &apos;s body was found .
the suspect is a cau@@ cas@@ ian fem@@ ale .
he painted a dog .
where did you hide the food ?
I get ch@@ apped li@@ ps every winter .
they dec@@ ei@@ ved us .
my feet are cold .
Mary accep@@ ted everything without complain@@ ing .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our escap@@ e was nothing short of a miracle .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I surviv@@ ed .
this glass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to choose .
my dog has cancer .
do you remember the day this picture was taken ?
what did she do to you ?
C@@ re@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the test .
can I speak to you a moment ?
they stood on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your favorite sk@@ in care produc@@ t ?
you can borrow three books at a time .
I &apos;m in absolu@@ tely to@@ tal agre@@ ement .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody needs to know this .
fall is late this year .
they &apos;re on good ter@@ ms with their neigh@@ b@@ ors .
I &apos;m using a new computer .
Mary always stu@@ di@@ es for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a ru@@ le .
who are you clo@@ s@@ est to in your family ?
you &apos;re worse than Tom .
do the Ger@@ m@@ ans have any other concer@@ ns in life a@@ part from con@@ su@@ mer@@ is@@ m ?
you should not respect a man because he is rich .
the ch@@ air cre@@ a@@ ked as he s@@ at down .
he ex@@ pressed his beli@@ ef in her hon@@ es@@ ty .
only they them@@ selves understand what they say .
no , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was crying for her mother .
they ru@@ ined it .
they want p@@ ea@@ ce .
are we being char@@ ged with something ?
I really hate d@@ ai@@ ry produc@@ ts .
I was right on the spo@@ t when it happened .
be punctual .
I am four@@ teen years old .
you look so pale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ar@@ d@@ v@@ ar@@ k is a me@@ di@@ um @-@ si@@ zed animal .
the school rules requ@@ ire students to wear school uni@@ form@@ s .
where can I buy books ?
I have two eyes .
I &apos;ve re@@ moved the com@@ ma .
do you have an ex@@ tra key ?
his bad leg pre@@ v@@ ented him from win@@ ning the ra@@ ce .
you &apos;re being par@@ an@@ o@@ id .
I &apos;m lucky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I admire her efforts .
we can &apos;t get close to the enemy .
there are a lot of stars lar@@ ger than our own S@@ un .
they aren &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to normal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good cook .
are you watching the pres@@ identi@@ al de@@ b@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .
who sp@@ read these rum@@ ours ?
that was written by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ ag@@ awa .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you considered me a close friend .
things will only get worse .
the girl is drinking tea .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your faul@@ t .
she met him on the beach .
they arrived at the hotel .
is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had gotten no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ pping off during the meeting .
haven &apos;t you eaten yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about religi@@ on .
who is there ?
he is str@@ on@@ ger than me .
I sw@@ ore I &apos;d never do that .
the dog came running to me .
Tom is th@@ ro@@ wing st@@ ones at bir@@ ds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ach .
she died last night .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child l@@ ab@@ or .
death before dish@@ on@@ or !
I o@@ iled my bicycle .
turn around .
this is not necessary .
we want re@@ ven@@ ge .
put on your shoes . let &apos;s go out for dinner .
you &apos;re fai@@ th@@ ful .
the train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
this show is stupid .
write Spanish .
don &apos;t even think of as@@ king me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it s@@ no@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not writing about you .
your question is not rel@@ ev@@ ant to the sub@@ ject .
she came to see me .
this ch@@ air is too small .
how much time do you actually spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the do@@ ors of per@@ c@@ ep@@ tion were cle@@ an@@ sed everything would app@@ ear to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
beer is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the porter for car@@ r@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great thin@@ kers who were un@@ known while alive became famous after death .
you &apos;re a terrible person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the s@@ pu@@ r of the moment .
in N@@ or@@ we@@ gi@@ an , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are gener@@ ally silent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat cand@@ y just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some inside information about the company &apos;s plans to go public .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no sooner had he seen it than he turned pale .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I appreciate the senti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
finish drinking your milk .
the old man died from hun@@ ger .
201@@ 6 is coming to an end and a new year is about to beg@@ in !
you &apos;re the ol@@ d@@ est .
I slept for eight hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like music ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I or@@ dered .
this is such a waste of time .
Tom is always playing video games .
I have been to the store before .
stop s@@ ending me flowers .
please un@@ dress from the wai@@ st up .
that &apos;s a stupid question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you re@@ gi@@ st@@ er your produc@@ t ?
Dan had to dec@@ ide wh@@ om to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ healthy .
there is a television in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .
I &apos;m trying to clean the house .
I haven &apos;t used An@@ k@@ i in a week and now I have 5@@ 00 fl@@ as@@ h@@ car@@ ds due .
the questions came fast and fu@@ ri@@ ous from the large number of re@@ por@@ ters who had g@@ ath@@ ered outside the cour@@ th@@ ouse .
I remember those days .
are you really as old as you say you are ?
Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the c@@ ap off this bottle .
I recogni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
Al@@ th@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is conten@@ ted .
I was bo@@ red .
if I were healthy , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thirsty .
have fun with that .
there is something tr@@ op@@ ical and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which form@@ s a sin@@ gu@@ lar contr@@ ast to her cool and un@@ em@@ o@@ tion@@ al brother .
go there tomorrow !
nobody would listen to me .
I can &apos;t prove it , you &apos;ll have to take my word for it .
do you have a sho@@ v@@ el I can borrow ?
you have changed since I saw you last year .
e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e , catch a ti@@ ger by his to@@ e , if he ho@@ ll@@ ers let him go , e@@ en@@ y , me@@ en@@ y , min@@ y , mo@@ e . my mother told me to catch the very best one and you are not it .
I &apos;ll go first .
how could anyone be so stupid ?
there &apos;s no ex@@ it .
it &apos;s on the sof@@ a .
we &apos;re looking for a place to sleep .
there &apos;s a du@@ ck on her shirt .
it &apos;s easy to have a clear conscience when it &apos;s not used .
are you veget@@ ari@@ an ?
if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the wor@@ kers are against the new plan .
they stayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
P@@ r@@ ay for all of us .
my brother depends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to sort this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
she &apos;s strong @-@ w@@ illed .
don &apos;t ask me again .
are you b@@ lowing me off ?
I can &apos;t believe I did this .
the teacher confis@@ c@@ ated a student &apos;s phone because he was tex@@ ting in class .
Jim hasn &apos;t come yet .
do you want something cold to drink ?
P@@ re@@ histo@@ ri@@ c men were sk@@ illed in k@@ n@@ app@@ ing .
we should h@@ ang out .
I found the book which I had lost the day before .
I didn &apos;t hear a s@@ pl@@ as@@ h .
I don &apos;t mind l@@ ending you the money pro@@ vi@@ ded you pay it back with@@ in a month .
Ah ... ok@@ ay , I was young , but what a stupid mistake !
in fact , I should thank you for this .
I was ar@@ res@@ ted on the spo@@ t .
I &apos;m studying art at school .
that never was an issue .
you should really l@@ ay off that . it &apos;ll ru@@ in your health .
the medicine had no eff@@ ect .
this is a book .
he doesn &apos;t get jo@@ kes .
that &apos;s not good enough for Tom .
it &apos;s a ser@@ ies of tu@@ bes .
Tom is here somewhere .
Tom stood very close to Mary .
he re@@ main@@ ed silent the whole time .
Tom &apos;s French pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation isn &apos;t as good as he thinks it is .
will they el@@ ect him for four more years ?
I got up too early .
since it rain@@ ed , I stayed home .
Tom put a st@@ ar on top of the Christmas tree .
we &apos;re not in school anymore .
I wake up at 7 o &apos;clock .
they have a plan .

the con@@ fus@@ ion beg@@ gars des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
don &apos;t be in such a hurry .
he drin@@ ks too much coffee .
maybe we should just give up .
I thought you were serious .
I &apos;ve done a really stupid thing .
how do you say that in French ?
her new novel has become a best sel@@ ler .
you go@@ tt@@ a get more organ@@ i@@ zed .
a mother kissed the child .
I &apos;ve got a ton of homework .
when Tom spoke , they all re@@ main@@ ed silent .
French is fas@@ cin@@ ating .
you &apos;re plan@@ ning something , aren &apos;t you ?
you should listen to his advice .
prices are double what they were ten years ago .
they &apos;re early .
Tom always had to win .
you should stop .
Tom pre@@ tended he had a gun .
as soon as I have it , I &apos;ll forward it to you .
this is for your prot@@ ection .
this is our only hope .
I think we should sell our old car .
I realize that there &apos;s a problem .
like a lea@@ f in the au@@ tu@@ m@@ n bre@@ e@@ ze .
the t@@ one of do@@ g@@ mati@@ s@@ m is in@@ spi@@ red by prof@@ ound ignor@@ ance .
Tom has a M@@ ac@@ book .

excuse me , I &apos;m lost .
I don &apos;t know where my keys are .
in the P@@ ic@@ ass@@ o M@@ us@@ eum in Paris , there are mar@@ vel@@ ous pain@@ t@@ ings and dra@@ win@@ gs !
the U@@ .@@ S@@ . pres@@ ident &apos;s pass@@ port is black , not blue like an aver@@ age ci@@ ti@@ z@@ en &apos;s .
this could have un@@ in@@ tended conse@@ qu@@ ences .
who does she think she is ?
Tom dec@@ lin@@ ed to comment .
we have considered your propos@@ al , and we have decided that we are not able to re@@ du@@ ce the price .
canc@@ el that .
those were his actu@@ al words .
we know where he is .
Re@@ peti@@ tion is the mother of all learning .
this car runs on al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
keep the dog out .
I like these ch@@ airs .
are you coming in or not ?
I &apos;m about to go out .
you can &apos;t help him .
I remember the war@@ m@@ th of his ar@@ ms .
why are you really doing this ?
you &apos;re very cl@@ ever .
I &apos;ll sleep on the futon .
Tom is not a her@@ o .
you &apos;re blo@@ c@@ king my view .
that &apos;s not good .
we could &apos;ve helped Tom .
Mary opened her pu@@ r@@ se and looked around in it .
I &apos;ve thought about it , and what we &apos;re doing is just not right , so let &apos;s break up after today .
you don &apos;t seem very pleased .
why don &apos;t you see for yourself ?
have you put on sun@@ s@@ cre@@ en ?
let &apos;s play ch@@ ess another time .
I &apos;ve never had a traffic accident .
a kiss is the best way to keep silent while saying it all .
with this tal@@ is@@ man , you can ward off any and all ev@@ il spi@@ ri@@ ts .
Tom has no money at all .
Tom has never d@@ anced with Mary .
I want to talk to her .
you ought to have been more careful .
they &apos;re just students .
I believ@@ ed you .
where exactly did you go ?
I have been silent for a long time .
I think he &apos;s happy .
nobody can believe in you more than yourself .
you &apos;re res@@ our@@ c@@ eful .
have you ever sli@@ pped on a banan@@ a pe@@ el ?
I &apos;ll probably come by c@@ ab .
she &apos;s in@@ sec@@ ure .
I &apos;m not in@@ vin@@ cible .
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on the pic@@ ni@@ c with him .
come over here and sit down .
I don &apos;t think I can do this anymore .
I bought a watch and an emp@@ ty box .
he &apos;s ru@@ th@@ less .
I slept very well last night .
it is gener@@ ally hard to adap@@ t to living in a fore@@ ign culture .
R@@ ev@@ en@@ ues are growing , but not as fast as costs .
hi , Susan . how are you ?
I was wonder@@ ing why you weren &apos;t here .
I will give you this book .
S@@ on@@ ia was a cute little br@@ un@@ ette , with so@@ ft eyes , sh@@ ado@@ wed by long l@@ as@@ h@@ es .
this lake is priv@@ ate . fishing here is for@@ bi@@ dden .
I could never do that .
he stood with his feet a@@ part .
after a bit of go@@ o@@ gl@@ ing , I suspect that what you said may not be true .
the cir@@ c@@ us is in town .
Tom is worried sick about Mary .
I &apos;d like to gr@@ adu@@ ate next spring .
the go@@ ods were trans@@ por@@ ted by ship .
where was this picture taken ?
she always arriv@@ es on time .
I have nothing to bo@@ ast about .
he is very angry .
as I turned the handle of the cr@@ an@@ k@@ sh@@ af@@ t , the old tr@@ ac@@ tor s@@ pu@@ t@@ tered to life .
a few serious problems rem@@ ain .
the hor@@ se is neigh@@ ing .
I have finished .
try to be more punctual from now on .
all maj@@ or cre@@ dit car@@ ds are accep@@ ted .
in En@@ gland the wai@@ ter asked us , &quot; H@@ o@@ w much beer would you like , a half p@@ int or a p@@ int ? &quot; having no idea how much that would be , we asked him to show us the glasses .
the scienti@@ sts have not found any ex@@ plan@@ ation for the myst@@ er@@ i@@ ous ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ on .
that &apos;s your half .
Tom has cut his fin@@ ger .
we chose a hotel near the sub@@ way .
the dog is sleeping at the fo@@ ot of the bed .
Tom came up with an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
the criti@@ cs shot us down .
Tom has to learn Japanese because he &apos;s going to Japan next year .
