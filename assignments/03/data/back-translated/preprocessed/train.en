I figured I could count on you .
we &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner served ?
I asked him for advice .

did you read it entirely ?
she &apos;s two years younger than him .
our teacher often overlooked his name on the list .
Tom still owes me a lot of money .
get the hell out my way !
be careful !
the population of Japan is larger than that of New Zealand .
I &apos;d prefer not to eat that .
the price rose .
the pain has lessened a little .
I wish I could explain to you how important this is to me .
any chance you know where I put my keys ?
that &apos;s terrible advice .
I &apos;ve come a long way .
you &apos;re all set ?
that &apos;s absolute nonsense !
the teacher punished her students for using bad words .
how can you accuse me of such a thing ? I would never lay a hand on my child .
Tom is thirsty .
he has a Southern accent .
don &apos;t give them to her .
I was ready today .
the problem is theirs .
in times of crisis one should never idealise the past .
you can &apos;t sit there .
I like to swim in the afternoon .
I left my umbrella in the cab .
I didn &apos;t even know you spoke French .
we get together once a year .
that was Tom &apos;s cousin .
I &apos;m not sure I &apos;d want to live here .

some teachers have a great effect on their students .
we &apos;re old friends .
we avoid talking about politics .
I am not available .
do you believe in Christianity ?
none of these cars are mine .

he is too drunk to drive home .
experience is the best teacher .
Tom was on TV yesterday .
painting is very easy when you do not know how to do it . when you know , it &apos;s very difficult .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
how did they get in here ?
I wonder if Tom will tell Mary the truth .
I &apos;m sorry to be so late . the meeting completely slipped my mind .
food is necessary for life .
that sounds good !
we chartered a bus .
ask me again some other time .
I don &apos;t want to upset you .
I can &apos;t wait .
recently the number of cars has greatly increased .
you &apos;ve omitted the preposition in this sentence .
enjoy yourself to the fullest .
Tom told me that he hadn &apos;t done that yet .
I am right .
I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that .
Tokyo is a very expensive place to live .
don &apos;t tell me that again .
I &apos;m bored . let &apos;s do something fun .
I &apos;m sure Tom intended to do that .
the firm has its head office in Osaka .
today , I was with a friend at the swimming pool .
Tom put some oat milk in his coffee .
I made him sweep the floor .
I don &apos;t have those answers .
my daughter likes to play with dolls .
have you ever been there ?
are you through with your work ?
you can &apos;t just leave your car parked in front of the fire hydrant .
I thought that you were going to wait for me .
can cats really see in the dark ?
one minute has sixty seconds .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s changed .
I &apos;ve had a perfectly wonderful evening . but this wasn &apos;t it .
keep your gun handy .
my name is Hopkins .
Tom woke up with heartburn .
he has written a letter .
why are you worried ?
I don &apos;t remember mailing the letter .
is all of this money yours ?
in 1912 , the Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died jumping off the first floor of the Eiffel Tower while trying out his new invention , the parachute coat , which did not work ...
Tom has chosen you .
I thought you were at work .
it was a very , very hot night .
everyone out !
why are you drying your hair ?
she didn &apos;t show up .
you seem happy .
there was no swelling .
my dog sometimes eats grass .
why are you so interested ?
no comment .
he is a gentleman .
you &apos;re very timid .
I have a red home .
the teacher can see you .
nobody knows exactly how many races make up the population of the United States .
the trees will soon be bare .
I thought she was stupid .
I awoke to find everything had been a dream .
she knows herself well .
how many times have you been in love in your life ?
do you eat rice every day ?
hardly had he entered the room , when she burst into tears .
I &apos;m not as afraid of heights as I used to be .
you &apos;ll be safe with her .
how long does it take by car ?
can we get some help ?
you must take advantage of the opportunity .
I opened a bottle of red wine .
you have a great imagination .
she volunteered to go to the meeting with him .
she &apos;s really smart , isn &apos;t she ?
you &apos;d better eat everything that &apos;s on your plate .
I admit I was surprised .
when will you return ?
you can &apos;t just come in here and start ordering people around .
what is the use of philosophy ?
I was ushered to my seat .
I had something planned .
Tom has traveled around the world .
Tom never gave up .
I don &apos;t really want to have another child .
the nun prayed and crossed herself .
I think I &apos;d rather not know .
she advised him where he should stay .
new blankets were distributed to the poor .
tell them what happened .
it did not come off .
I promise you I &apos;ll keep you safe .
it isn &apos;t expensive .
Holy Tom !
here is a letter for you .
he &apos;s beating me , three to zip .
they all entered .
the goldfish is alive .
she urged him to consider the request .
it &apos;ll be easy to find someone to do that .
like it ?
you didn &apos;t let me answer .
Greetings , stranger .
have you seen him before ?
the tree fell over in the typhoon .
what kind of music does Tom like ?
this ticket is valid for three days .
I &apos;m innocent .
she walks .
they came last week .

could you add me ?
I suppose we have nothing to lose .
I wanted you to see that I &apos;m not all that bad .
I &apos;m afraid that Tom is involved in a crime .
if your answer is correct , it follows that mine is wrong .
Tom and Mary had their honeymoon in a foreign land .
we tried to cheer her up .
they burned all the documents .
you &apos;re the same age as my girlfriend .
I have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
no one believed you .
the hall was decorated with Japanese paintings .
if I were in your place , I would lend him a hand .
nobody suspected anything .
I don &apos;t have much money now .
she made me hurry .
they ironed out their differences .
these aren &apos;t my keys .
we are having lunch .
a growing child requires more food .
how long did they live in England ?
how is your daughter ?
it &apos;s lunch time .
see what happens when you give people advice ?
it &apos;s time for us to get ready .
if he doesn &apos;t come , we won &apos;t go .
what &apos;s wrong with you tonight ?
I can &apos;t believe that you aren &apos;t at least willing to consider the possibility of other alternatives .
you don &apos;t have to come .
I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel .
I was completely devastated .
he turned his thoughts toward home .
you don &apos;t need to come so early .
I asked Tom if he needed more money .
Tom knows that he can win .
I am very tired from the hard work .
I &apos;ve already told everybody to go home .
Tom never reached Australia .
we should have set off earlier .
I mean to go tomorrow if the weather is fine .
may comes after April .
his death was a great loss to our firm .
my older brother is an authority on philosophy .
everybody needs to calm down .
there &apos;s a great restaurant around the corner .

I want you to have a job that you love .

I don &apos;t want to play with you any more .
be on your guard against pickpockets .
the girls are excited .
what time &apos;s your train ?
he spun her around , took her in his arms , dipped her back , and gave her a big Hollywood kiss .
Tom is usually very quiet , isn &apos;t he ?

in my opinion , he is correct .
I have enough money to buy it .
are there any bananas ?
he is a scientist .
Tom wanted me to learn French .
the Cold War ended when the Soviet Union collapsed .
we have to do this .
your wish is a command for me .
he would not take the money .
she made a lot of money .
this apple is sour .
did you have a pleasant trip ?
Tom never gives anything to anybody .
Helen Keller was blind , deaf and dumb .
she didn &apos;t exactly agree with me .
I am wondering if I could be of any service to you .
Tom isn &apos;t Mary &apos;s father .
I like all of the songs Tom sings .
Defenestrate your clock to see how time flies .
