I figured I could count on you .
we &apos;d like another bottle of wine .
may I put it down here ?
if Tom has a problem with me , he should tell me .
at what time is dinner served ?
I asked him for advice .
she is always for@@ getting my phone number .
what has become of him since then ?
she doesn &apos;t study as hard as her sister .
you would like it .
the price is reasonable .

have you ever had a lo@@ ver who was never in the way ?
I &apos;ve already filled out the form .
bring an umbrella without for@@ getting .
I &apos;d prefer to die rather than give up .
Tom doesn &apos;t like ma@@ th .
she advised him to talk about his life in the United States .
she turned her eyes away .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be fine .
where have you been up to now ?
you never have any doub@@ ts , do you ?
Tom burst out laughing .
I can not afford to buy a used car .
we caught him red @-@ hand@@ ed .
I &apos;m sorry I had to leave you alone .
I had nothing to do with that .
I never go out .
in about ten minutes , you &apos;ll find out more .
I am asking you for patience .
it &apos;ll be hard to find a re@@ placement for him .
it &apos;s cal@@ m .
she was hit by a car .
Tom would &apos;ve made the same decision I &apos;m making if he were in my shoes .
I have a large bed@@ room .
let the cat out .
I finally met her .
I &apos;ll go wher@@ ever you want me to go .
it is less cold today than it was yesterday .
there have been a lot of compl@@ aints about the way Tom behav@@ es .
we &apos;re not invited .
you need to fil@@ ter the out@@ put of this comm@@ and in order to display only the lines with &quot; fo@@ o &quot; inside .
he has a daughter who is very pretty .
don &apos;t throw the ball near the windows .
the Earth is like a ball with a large mag@@ net inside .
that &apos;s just what I needed .
promise me you won &apos;t tell her .
I don &apos;t care who we give it to .
we want further information .
I could hardly en@@ dure the pain .
don &apos;t back away .
this doesn &apos;t look good .
I caught a beautiful but@@ ter@@ fly .
French was the language of diplo@@ ma@@ cy .
I can &apos;t tell you how angry that makes me .
what do you love ? what do you hate ?
how much is your h@@ our@@ ly pay ?
how could I lie to you ?
he was a Fren@@ ch@@ man . I could tell by his accent .
I will never understand .
we &apos;ll respon@@ d .
as my father and my grandfather have many siblings , there are a lot of kids in our family .
did you see him go out ?
Sami has been married six times .
my father does not eat much fruit .
the ver@@ b &quot; to be &quot; has an ir@@ regular con@@ jug@@ ation in all languages .
do you want me to repe@@ at the question ?
do I have to go now ?
a home is more than a me@@ re building .
have you already eaten ?
it &apos;s really aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
he always takes L@@ é@@ a on his la@@ p to read her a story .
I don &apos;t go out much .
Tom is not a true w@@ arri@@ or .
Tom needs lots of courage and pers@@ ever@@ ance because he has to pay attention to so many things at the same time .
I &apos;m reading a letter .
it must &apos;ve cost a fortune .
thank you for invit@@ ing me to dinner .
I want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t be afraid of the dog who bar@@ ks , but be afraid of the one who is silent and w@@ ag@@ s its tai@@ l .
what did you just say ?
they make a great team .
the separ@@ ati@@ sts think that I &apos;m k@@ id@@ ding .
the bicycle is mine .
we think we &apos;ve found a way to help you .
I am applying for a job .
that &apos;s not what happened here .
I ate some pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
I use the Internet as a resour@@ ce for my research .
he said he was poor .
she thinks about him all the time .
he has his own room .
I don &apos;t know who else to turn to for help .
this dr@@ aw@@ ing took me five minutes , but I took si@@ x@@ ty years to get there .
I don &apos;t want to live by your rules .
I didn &apos;t stop .
she took the news cal@@ m@@ ly .
how &apos;s everybody doing ?
we &apos;re wa@@ sting time .
what did you get hit with ?
cars are expensive .
they were not impressed .
to tell the truth , I dro@@ ve my father &apos;s car without his permission .
he is Japanese to the b@@ one .
we got@@ ta have all the data in there .
she doesn &apos;t want him to buy an expensive engagement ring .
I think it &apos;s time for me to get my own place .
you know what you must do .
he is twice as old as she is .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
is this what you were looking for ?
write in the date yourself .
there is no hope .
cut that out !
I have to put my shoes on .
Tom is an archit@@ ect , right ?
were you busy ?
I de@@ fe@@ ated the w@@ arri@@ or .
you are not the only one responsible for it , I am too .
I never wanted this .
I try to travel with only one su@@ it@@ case .
you &apos;re wa@@ sting both of our time .
early expl@@ or@@ ers used the stars for nav@@ ig@@ ation .
his salary is too low to support his family on .
this is a very time @-@ con@@ sum@@ ing task .
your phone is r@@ inging again .
Tom wants to marry Mary .
who asked you to do that ?
have a piece of pi@@ e .
long , long ago , there lived an old man in a village .
let &apos;s walk a little faster .
I know exactly where I am .
my mom bought me this to@@ y when I was eight years old .
I hope we &apos;re not making a hu@@ ge mistake .
breakfast is served .
this is il@@ legal .
I &apos;m not in the mo@@ od to go for a walk .
I &apos;d like to see that ring , please .
are you sure you want to leave without saying go@@ od@@ b@@ ye ?
we man@@ aged to swim across the river .
Mary wants to brea@@ st@@ fe@@ ed her baby , but she &apos;s not making enough milk .
who is he talking to ?
what &apos;s the best cure for lon@@ el@@ iness ?
would you mind speaking more slow@@ ly ?
do you want to stay here all night ?
Tom poin@@ ted out my mistake .
the pa@@ tro@@ l@@ man mo@@ tion@@ ed me to pu@@ ll over .
I &apos;ll send you a post@@ card .
I &apos;d like to get you both to help me .
there &apos;s nothing there .
I know that you &apos;re very angry .
you should try to have fun .
I never thought I &apos;d see Tom again .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s easy .
it &apos;s against the law .
she has no less than ten children .
all that glis@@ ters is not gold .
one of the guar@@ ds is dead .
you owe it to yourself to do it .
parents must provide their children with pro@@ per food and clo@@ thing .
I just want you to know how sorry I am .
don &apos;t be@@ at about the bus@@ h .
would you like to sleep a little longer ?
you are supposed to o@@ be@@ y the law .
whatever you do , don &apos;t p@@ ush that but@@ ton .
I love the out@@ fit you &apos;re wearing .
are you accus@@ ing me of che@@ ating ?
you can &apos;t drive now . you &apos;ve been drinking .
I &apos;m sorry , but I can &apos;t res@@ ist .
&quot; does she have a dog ? &quot; &quot; no , she doesn &apos;t . &quot;
Tom wanted to see him .
this house is mine .
we were very careful .
I think it &apos;s OK .
follow your heart , for it never lies .
do you have any small change ?
don &apos;t st@@ are at me like that .
I wanted your opinion .
my father , who is now working in America , wrote us a letter last week .
why did you come home so late ?
the contract is in the bag , so let &apos;s go out and celebr@@ ate .
according to fol@@ k@@ tal@@ es , cats have nine lives .
he was speaking .
I &apos;m not going to Spain on holiday .
Tom didn &apos;t know whether he should do that or not .
this broken vase cannot be re@@ paired .
we must have faith in the president .
how did you get into our room ?
we had to less@@ en the impact of the err@@ ati@@ c suppl@@ ies .
he has not written to them for a long time .
I can understand what she is saying .
do whatever you like .
I was in all day .
it looks like a du@@ ck .
we cannot rule out the possibility that civil war will break out in that country .
I called him , but a girl answ@@ ered the phone .
Tom was watching him so@@ w sal@@ ad .
if you don &apos;t want me to go , I won &apos;t .
&quot; should I mea@@ sure the fl@@ our out ? &quot; &quot; you can ey@@ eball it if you want . &quot;
sign this .
whose book is this ?
he d@@ anced like a lea@@ f in the autumn win@@ d .
you must be ca@@ uti@@ ous .
she promised to meet him at the coffee shop .
he &apos;s very polite .
pick@@ pock@@ ets may operate in this area .
this hat is too small . please show me another one .
they forgot to lock the door .
speaking English isn &apos;t easy , but interesting .
we need to remember that .
we must talk her out of this fo@@ ol@@ ish plan .
yes , as far as I know .
I was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing .
it &apos;s cold outside .
please be@@ at the eggs .
I know it &apos;s un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic to expect Tom to do that .
a wh@@ ale is a mam@@ mal .
I wrote down his phone number on a s@@ cr@@ ap of paper .
I hope it &apos;s not just a curi@@ os@@ ity .
I can &apos;t imagine my life without Tom .
in@@ spi@@ red by her teachers , P@@ har@@ amp is going to start her so@@ lar career tomorrow .
I lost the bet .
are there surviv@@ ors ?
does he speak ? he sings , rather ! since I seas@@ oned it , we can no longer stop it .
Americans eat special foods on T@@ han@@ k@@ s@@ giving .
we &apos;ve had a lot of compl@@ aints about how you treat your class@@ ma@@ tes .
she cannot write or read .
turn on the TV .
I missed my favour@@ ite ser@@ ies .
I hope you will be completely cur@@ ed .
did that work ?
excuse me , is there a hotel around here ?
a high school student made this ro@@ bo@@ t .
if you don &apos;t want to go , you don &apos;t have to .
they &apos;re dead .
my go@@ d is the greatest !
my father is arriv@@ ing at the station at five .
you can &apos;t drink s@@ ea@@ water because it &apos;s too sal@@ ty .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re happy .
you &apos;re my best customer .
you had better go .
is this really what you want to do ?
Tom has been absent from school for three days .
you don &apos;t know who I am .
not everything is about you .
ro@@ om@@ s are black .
you don &apos;t need to turn up your ther@@ most@@ at when it &apos;s cold outside .
Tom is standing over there near the fi@@ re@@ place .
do you mind if I turn down the TV ?
I tried that .
Tom went to my room .
why are you busy today ?
when he ran into difficulties , he asked his parents for help .
where did you learn this ?
do you have a ticket ?
I go to the park .
you could hear a pin drop .
anybody can make a mistake .
she helped me out coun@@ t@@ less times .
let &apos;s wait and see how things go .
his wife opened the door for him .
it is not you but her that he wants to marry .
that made me very s@@ ad .
I don &apos;t have time to go to the movies .
I want to pay with a check .
there is little milk in the j@@ ar .
I don &apos;t think I said that .
I &apos;ll teach you what you need to know .
it would be so cool if I could speak ten languages !
we dec@@ lar@@ ed war .
she cross@@ ed her legs .
we need to find an eff@@ ective me@@ th@@ od .
she is not ashamed of her mis@@ conduct .
the field was r@@ ank with wee@@ ds .
to rule a country is no easy task .
I rar@@ ely go to the movies .
you should not wear a fu@@ r coat .
I think you &apos;re a geni@@ us .
I &apos;d like you to meet my husband .
I &apos;ll get my son to go instead of going myself .
where do I go then ?
Mary filed a pa@@ tent at the pa@@ tent office .
Dan cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated Linda &apos;s story .
if the government doesn &apos;t subsi@@ dis@@ e the car industry , it will stru@@ gg@@ le b@@ ad@@ ly and may even c@@ ease to exist .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t help us .
she heard him sing .
they p@@ ushed him out of the window .
I myself have , before becoming employed by this company , twice spoken bl@@ un@@ tly to the people at the top .
she decided to res@@ ign her job .
this is not acceptable .
that was fun , wasn &apos;t it ?
it is on a tree br@@ an@@ ch that a bir@@ d buil@@ ds its n@@ est .
would you know a ch@@ ea@@ p hotel in the near ?
the world &apos;s greatest sing@@ ers and most of its famous musici@@ ans have been fat or at least deci@@ de@@ dly plu@@ m@@ p .
guess what they got ! a bo@@ w@@ ler hat for him and lea@@ ther boo@@ ts for her !
marriage is the union of a man and woman .
Tom is in the ski lo@@ dge .
there could be no com@@ promise .
an apple a day keeps the doctor away .
I &apos;ll leave you two alone .
are you ready to fly ?
what a dis@@ aster !
come inside . it &apos;s cold outside .
she gave me a fa@@ ke phone number .
he is the t@@ all@@ est boy .
I went to bed early because I was tired .
men and women need each other .

that &apos;s where I work .
wash your feet .
he sm@@ ells bad .
I &apos;m busy getting ready for tomorrow .
she works for French intelligen@@ ce .
when I saw it , it took my bre@@ ath away .
my patience gave out .
at sev@@ enty , my father is still very active .
I wanted to talk to you because I need your help .
Bob is the only student that can speak Spanish in our class .
I never expected that she would join us .
only the most im@@ pec@@ ca@@ ble dish@@ es are served to the ro@@ yal family .
I &apos;m not like you .
where is the bus stop ?
I sho@@ wed my ticket to the do@@ or@@ man and went into the theatre .
in which street ?
he &apos;s d@@ ating my daughter .
can you tell me what this word means ?
I think they want you to do it .
I read anger in her face .
how many classes do you have on Mon@@ days ?
it ble@@ w my mind .
it &apos;s the dy@@ nam@@ ic inter@@ action between the charac@@ ters that makes this novel so great .
we have to make sure that we never do this again .
I like the m@@ elo@@ dy of this song .
is that thing working ?
she will be coming to see us again soon .
of course !
I don &apos;t think her story is true .
her hobby was coll@@ ecting old co@@ ins .
he has big problems .
H@@ ar@@ b@@ in is very cold .
I caught a cold two days ago .
I &apos;m here not because of that .
she doesn &apos;t know how to ride a bike .
it would be a good idea to try doing that .
did we miss anything ?
I couldn &apos;t do this without your help .
Tom is a natural ath@@ le@@ te .
I guess I &apos;ve gotten lazy .
what do you regret most ?
Tom knew there was something in the box , but he didn &apos;t know what .
I &apos;m in charge here .
che@@ ese and but@@ ter are products made from milk .

Tom has a lot of things to do this morning before he leaves the house .
come near the fire .
do you mind if I watch TV for a while ?
he can b@@ end an ir@@ on ro@@ d with his hands .
you &apos;re not allowed to leave this room .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his dog .
he &apos;s promis@@ ing us nothing .
I recomm@@ end it highly .
that &apos;s all going to change .
he is away from home .
I appreciate anything you can do .
inv@@ ite him over to watch a movie .
without lies truth would per@@ ish of des@@ pair and bo@@ re@@ dom .
I have much work today .
tell Tom .
I called him to the telephone .
few people can realize their faul@@ ts .
birds have shar@@ p vision .
who is Tom ?
Mary took the co@@ ok@@ ies out of the ov@@ en .
he doesn &apos;t know how to write a letter in English .
he is something of a celebr@@ ity .
life is a my@@ st@@ ery to be lived , not a problem to be solved .
I won &apos;t be able to stop .
I don &apos;t know the theater play , but I know the au@@ th@@ or well .
sev@@ enty @-@ five divided by five is fi@@ f@@ teen .

My@@ S@@ Q@@ L lo@@ ad@@ s several t@@ ables .
I must have gone past the station while I was taking a na@@ p .
I forgot that you &apos;re Tom &apos;s best friend .
the discre@@ p@@ ancy between the stor@@ ies of the two parties involved in the accident was so great that the authorities had a hard time deci@@ ding which side was telling the truth .
in case of rain , the ath@@ le@@ tic meeting will be called off .
there is a cat .
be careful !
I love your son .
where are your car keys ?
I think of you as a friend .
you have no need to be ashamed .
A@@ le@@ jan@@ dra wrote to her pen pa@@ l in I@@ tal@@ y .
his ni@@ e@@ ce is at@@ tr@@ active and ma@@ ture for her age .
you do like living danger@@ ously .
spring has re@@ turned . the Earth is like a child that knows po@@ ems .
what did I do wrong ?
W@@ i@@ pe your tears .
it took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English .
it &apos;s getting har@@ der for me to concentr@@ ate .
I &apos;m not cre@@ ative .
the books were so val@@ u@@ able that they were handled with the greatest care .
they have lost a lot .
looks like we bar@@ ked up the wrong tree .
I have questions .
I didn &apos;t start all this .
I wish you could have come with me .
as a matter of fact , all great dis@@ cover@@ ers have been regarded as dream@@ ers .
thank you , I &apos;d like to stay in your house .
I promise that you won &apos;t be disappointed .
can you drive manual ?
Tom seems very happy .
show me how to do that .
I mess@@ ed up .
I think I did something wrong .
Tom has already told Mary not to do that anymore .
he &apos;s a ch@@ ain smo@@ ker .
pe@@ as@@ ants often have a secondary activity to aug@@ ment their income .
our pass@@ ports were cancelled .
medicine should be out of the way of children .
that word descri@@ bes it perf@@ ec@@ tly .
he works for her .
help me out here .
where do you live in Tur@@ key ?
why are you so clu@@ m@@ s@@ y ?
help me .
don &apos;t stay here .
the neighb@@ or &apos;s dog is always bar@@ king .
I plan to go to her co@@ ck@@ tai@@ l party .
Tom has agreed to help us .
I &apos;m super hungry .
we &apos;re getting no@@ where with those problems .
it &apos;s my faul@@ t !
if the situation doesn &apos;t improve , I &apos;ll be obliged to take mea@@ sures .
I have an umbrella in my car .
whose shoes are these ?
Tom doesn &apos;t eat be@@ ef .
do you know where he went ?
the bear is big .
I &apos;ll take your su@@ it@@ case to your room , sir .
it &apos;s as you say .
the door needs another coat of paint .
I told you so !
he always went fishing on the river when he was young .
he has three sons .
could you please tell me again how many times you &apos;ve been here ?
if you wanted to improve your Spanish , you shouldn &apos;t have come to Chi@@ le .
I know you like to travel .
Tom would just like to know what he did wrong .
when did he come here ?
I &apos;ll keep this cake for myself .
don &apos;t talk back to me like that .
this summer we &apos;ll go to the moun@@ tains and to the sea .
as far as I know , he has never come on time .
he av@@ eng@@ ed the mur@@ der of his father .
my watch lo@@ ses ten minutes a day .
he is completely bes@@ ot@@ ted with her .
let &apos;s do it your way .
it &apos;s so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air condi@@ tion@@ ed house .
I was fal@@ sel@@ y accused .
he didn &apos;t know how to express himself .
Tom said Mary was happy .
someone was killed .
she will make us a nice dinner .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no way ?
I heard them coming .
I had a head@@ ache , so I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s a@@ head of schedule .
Tom rar@@ ely hu@@ gs Mary anymore .
she didn &apos;t want him to play po@@ ker .
when we look at other places in the universe , it could very well be that photo@@ sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic life is the exception .
it &apos;s true that it would be easier for students if there were only one single Spanish dial@@ ect , but that &apos;s quite far from being the case .
I won &apos;t run away like a co@@ ward .
where &apos;s your daughter ?
you must take your parents advice seriously .
I &apos;ll get there before you .
he came to meet me yesterday afternoon .
I haven &apos;t told the kids yet that we &apos;re getting divorced .
let me carry it for you .
I prefer to write in French .
he failed the entrance exam .
someone was here .
I don &apos;t care what he does .
I &apos;ll go take a shower now .
the house closest to here is two mil@@ es away .
her age qualifi@@ es her for the job .
he acted like a lun@@ ati@@ c .
they can &apos;t do that .
are you listening ?
I could really make things hard for you , you know .
you &apos;ve ris@@ ked enough .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
I gave my brother a dictionary .
if I &apos;d only taken your advice !
she &apos;s well st@@ acked .
Sami thinks he did very well in the exam .
I didn &apos;t study at all yesterday .
you can &apos;t leave us like this .
one of my plea@@ sures is watching TV .
we need to get out of here .
were there any stars in the sky ?
Tom apologi@@ zed .
I just wanted to see if I could do it .
the fo@@ g is growing th@@ ick@@ er .
I don &apos;t know anybody in Boston .
I &apos;m a lucky man .
ear@@ ning our customers confi@@ dence and respect is this firm &apos;s objective .
what will the neighb@@ ors think ?
you can &apos;t prove a thing .
this school suppl@@ ies students with tex@@ t@@ books .
his del@@ ay of coming here on time is due to a traffic accident .
we need a str@@ at@@ e@@ gy .
Japan has a lot of trade with Canada .
shut the window to prevent cat@@ ching a cold .
it &apos;s dangerous here .
Tom took a day off .
the D@@ ead S@@ ea lies bel@@ ow sea level .
Mary &apos;s favorite movie is The Pr@@ in@@ cess B@@ ride .
the situation is under control .
I miss you already .
when did you become a teacher ?
they are my friends .
you might as well go kill yourself .
we play a sport .
he isn &apos;t rich , but he &apos;s happy .
I &apos;m just looking out for myself .
he l@@ ac@@ ks t@@ act .
we were concer@@ ned .
A@@ chi@@ ev@@ ing a nice wel@@ d b@@ ead is not within everyone &apos;s reach !
it was not a complete vi@@ ct@@ ory .
we elected Tom cap@@ tain of the team .
I &apos;m very sorry I got home so late .
funny !
I can &apos;t do that .
she hand@@ ed me a post@@ card .
I just have to do something .
nobody insul@@ ts my country .
do you have any kind of ali@@ b@@ i ?
I think you would like it here .
his answer was favor@@ able .
how many col@@ ours are there ?
the language of friend@@ ship is not words but mean@@ ings .
if you want my help , you &apos;ll have to ask for it .
I spent a week with a P@@ al@@ est@@ in@@ ian family from G@@ az@@ a .
we &apos;re working to fix this bu@@ g .
let me congratul@@ ate you on your engagement .
a t@@ sun@@ ami is coming , so please be on the al@@ ert .
why did you tell him that ?
Tom was aw@@ fully bor@@ ed .
the nu@@ ll hypo@@ thes@@ is states how often a s@@ am@@ pl@@ ing err@@ or alone will produ@@ ce results that are different than a fore@@ ca@@ st .
at the party there was food in ab@@ un@@ dance .
I want you to speak fran@@ k@@ ly .
they are seeing their uncle tomorrow .
I &apos;m on the inter@@ state .
I don &apos;t have a girlfriend .
I figured I might find you here .
Tom r@@ ushed past me .
news of her death caused great concer@@ n throughout the country .
Tom is bit@@ ing his n@@ ails .
how many of you are there now ?
I &apos;m smar@@ ter than you .
you &apos;re very nice .
I couldn &apos;t enter because the door was closed .
the new tunnel will link B@@ rit@@ ain and France .
instead of going to school , he stayed at home .
I wish you were here with me now .
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed .
I must br@@ ush up my English .
it is in the restaurant where Dan eats lunch .
they g@@ ang@@ ed up on him .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s happening .
Tom rum@@ maged through the dra@@ wer , looking for a pen@@ cil .
do you need a ride home later ?
I took the little girl by the hand .
my father spen@@ ds a lot of time on his hobby .
you che@@ ated .
do you know how to play the piano ?
I wanted to make sure you were all right .
you &apos;ve found it .
I don &apos;t understand your res@@ istance .
Mon@@ days aren &apos;t good for me .
the weather today is worse than yesterday .
I plan to have lunch with him .
she is wat@@ ering the flowers .
I think Tom eats too much me@@ at .
what direction are you going ?
I wish there were a French translation of this book .
down came the rain in tor@@ rents .
she tried to com@@ fort him , but he kept crying .
that won &apos;t change anything .
the most wa@@ sted day of all is that on which we have not laughed .
the way tour@@ ists dress off@@ ends local stand@@ ards of propri@@ ety .
we can &apos;t give up .
it &apos;s a mis@@ understanding .
they want someone to help them .
I &apos;m too tired to ar@@ gue .
that lies outside my area of study .
my uncle has a house in I@@ tal@@ y .
she turned down my offer .
Tom has three boys and a girl .
my boyfriend looks like your girlfriend .
Tom was in the shower .
we &apos;ll meet at my house .
you &apos;re the teacher .
we &apos;ve lost faith in human@@ ity .
you must &apos;ve thought I was an idiot .
did he forget his money again ?
look out for rock sli@@ des .

I can &apos;t live without a TV .

the kitchen is not a suitable place for ar@@ gu@@ ments . too many kni@@ ves .
we came by to wish you luck .
I &apos;m yours .
they never talk but they quar@@ rel .
we &apos;re tr@@ apped !
I want to see them .
I can &apos;t do it alone .
one is never so happy as one thinks .
I have nothing to say about that .

how do you respon@@ d to that ?
I &apos;m not crazy .
dinner &apos;s ready .

I want you to help us .
I think you made the right choice .
what were you studying last night ?
I &apos;m disappointed and angry .
&quot; do you want to go to the ball with me ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really sorry , but I can &apos;t . &quot;
we walked to my room .

I started with two travel@@ ing comp@@ ani@@ ons .
what &apos;s the name of that bir@@ d ?
I can &apos;t go with you .

good thing I learned English .
you have a watch .
can I touch your hair ?
just do it .
do you want this shirt ?
what condition is the building in ?
no matter how hard I try , I can &apos;t do it any better than she can .
she was horri@@ fied .
her French has gotten much better .
the door is lo@@ cked .
you might want to take a look at this .
all you have to do is to concentr@@ ate .
would you be willing to send me a s@@ am@@ ple free of charge ?
French isn &apos;t my native language .
we &apos;re all very good play@@ ers .
it &apos;s as cold as ice .
I &apos;m sick of this .
I want everything to be perfect .
what were you waiting for ?
you can &apos;t attend ? why not ?
for all our efforts , things have not turned out better .
Tom should pay what he ow@@ es .

you don &apos;t look very comfortable .
you shouldn &apos;t be afraid of the future .
we &apos;ve been aband@@ oned .
I was a victim of a pick@@ pock@@ et .
since there was no taxi , I had to walk home .
during my childhood , I often came here to observe the sur@@ r@@ ound@@ ings and me@@ dit@@ ate .
no , you don &apos;t know J@@ ava . you know J@@ av@@ a@@ S@@ C@@ R@@ I@@ P@@ T .

Tom sh@@ av@@ ed off his be@@ ard and dy@@ ed his hair bl@@ onde , ho@@ ping people wouldn &apos;t recogni@@ ze him .
my hobby is to cook .
who do you think can help me ?
do you have an auto@@ mobile ?
in autumn , the moon is very beautiful .
you know what might happen , don &apos;t you ?
I owe what I am today to my parents .
I &apos;m coming to your res@@ cue !
if I &apos;d known the truth , I &apos;d have told you .
she served me coffee .
English cannot be ma@@ st@@ ered over@@ night .
the beautiful is always strange .
I think I could handle that .
I had a good time , too .
my time has not yet come .
he &apos;s a goal kee@@ per .
that &apos;s very big .
it &apos;s not why I &apos;m here .
this is serious , Tom .
you &apos;re all alone .
I &apos;ll explain it all later .
you &apos;ll have a wonderful time .
he wants to reach a wid@@ er au@@ di@@ ence .
I always walk .
I owe my success to my friends .

&quot; are you serious ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;m absolu@@ tely serious . &quot;
I fir@@ ed the gun .
Oh you poor little thing .
he jum@@ ped into the water .
I &apos;ve finished .
I want you to keep your promise .
Tom married an older woman .
every mo@@ vement is pain@@ ful .
she liked everything about him .
I &apos;m not sure what &apos;s wrong with her .
I did war@@ n you .
that &apos;s my car .
I &apos;m not going to do that until Monday .
I meant to call her , but I forgot to .
you don &apos;t look very strong .
I completely appro@@ ve of this .
Tom took part in the summer festiv@@ al .

in two moves , K@@ as@@ paro@@ v will check the chall@@ eng@@ er .
I &apos;m glad to be home .
I thought it would be a good idea to get back in touch with Japanese culture and history .
she looked trou@@ bl@@ ed by the news .
what you &apos;re doing makes me nervous .
do you mind much ?
it is clou@@ dy now .
the show starts at noon .
I can &apos;t go to the restaurant with you tonight .
I &apos;m not at work today .
you &apos;re very understanding .
French is my favorite language .
I think that she &apos;s hid@@ ing something .
don &apos;t leave me yet , Tom .
you have to try again .
it won &apos;t be long before they get married .
no one could see us .
we &apos;re ready now .
she threaten@@ ed to set our house on fire .
the wh@@ ale is well known to be the largest mam@@ mal .

the risks are too great .
Ste@@ ph@@ en Col@@ ber@@ t is a pretty crazy guy .
give it back to me .
Mr Smith tea@@ ches me English .
the el@@ ev@@ ator seems to be out of order .
I sometimes have a hard time choo@@ sing whether I should listen to reason or my feelings .
do you want a few more minutes ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to wash my car .
you should get that sof@@ a reu@@ pho@@ l@@ st@@ ered .
the old woman is too wea@@ k to get out of bed .
even if it costs 10@@ ,000 yen , I must buy the dictionary .
he is so old that he cannot walk quickly .
please wait a moment .
prepare yourself .
they admitted they were scared .
I was going to go .
I thought you did that last week .
I really enjoy spen@@ ding time with you .
I did all the work myself .
does he go to school by bus ?
there are too many of them .
we have to ask everybody this .
he got his dan@@ der up .
it &apos;s a fruit .
I &apos;m l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you &apos;ve got to answer the question .
Tom doesn &apos;t believe in life after death .
I &apos;m tired of eating at the school caf@@ eter@@ ia .
summer is coming to an end .
will you leave a message ?
how lon@@ ely and hel@@ pl@@ ess she must feel left all by herself !
as the first pack emer@@ ges , the spe@@ ct@@ ators take pictures with their camer@@ as and mobile phones .
why are you even here ?
I don &apos;t have anything else to do but wait for you .
my mother told me I needed to eat less cand@@ y .
I didn &apos;t scre@@ am .
I guess what I &apos;ve said isn &apos;t all that clear , but that &apos;s the only way I can explain it .
she will be able to answer your question .
how long have you been here for ?
there are many people trying to buy houses .
it &apos;s in the garage .
you talk really fast .
that &apos;s not really a solution .
he &apos;s gone into hid@@ ing .
Mr B@@ ro@@ wn is our financial advis@@ er .
I am an arti@@ st .
you should buy her new toys .
I had a hun@@ ch you would do that .

I like funny guys .
I usually get up at eight .

this desk has lost one of its legs .
we have a few questions for you .
I will go even if it r@@ ains .
is it possible to determine the diam@@ eter from the circum@@ fer@@ ence ?
do you plan to work until 10 : 00 ?
and on sun@@ ny days all the pi@@ geons f@@ le@@ w home .
are you feeling OK ?
Sami res@@ emb@@ les the suspect .
what is your number ?
we believe in a better world .
is she still single ?
I didn &apos;t enjoy the party at all .
she aimed at the targ@@ et .
we like her .
we &apos;re all after the same thing .
it &apos;s getting dark outside .
I can &apos;t read Arabic s@@ cri@@ pt .
they h@@ ated Tom .
I can &apos;t do it alone . I need your help .
I don &apos;t agree with the theory that one should learn L@@ atin in order to better understand English .
I &apos;m being serious !
you alone can do it , but you can &apos;t do it alone .
you don &apos;t want to know .
what do you think this is made of ?
I need to ask a few questions .
I need proof .
Tom doesn &apos;t sing very well .

no one can den@@ y the fact .
above all things , we must not be sel@@ fish .
I have difficulty concentr@@ ating .

I &apos;ll stay involved .
this happened pri@@ or to receiving your letter .
Tom likes technology .
what do you think he did ?
the plant is blue .
we &apos;re getting out of here .
the government is re@@ des@@ ig@@ ning the cur@@ ren@@ cy to try and cut down on coun@@ ter@@ fe@@ it@@ ing .
a@@ ci@@ d rain is not a natural ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on .
we should pres@@ erve the beau@@ ties of the countryside .
I can get us there more quickly .
I don &apos;t think Tom can play the tru@@ m@@ pe@@ t .
I think that fact is very important .
I don &apos;t know what I owe you .
the less we think , the more we talk .
she &apos;s waiting for you at home .
I can &apos;t find anything .
I &apos;ll be there at 2 : 30 .
carry these books back to the boo@@ k@@ shel@@ f .
have a nice trip .
the train is leaving right away .
look , I don &apos;t want to lose my job .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?

I &apos;ll do whatever you want .
she plays the flu@@ te .
they look so cute together .
Tom wi@@ ped his glasses .
it really h@@ its the n@@ ail on the head .
she has international ren@@ own as a pain@@ ter .
I saw Tom slip and fall .
take your coat off and make yourself at home .
a man &apos;s worth lies not so much in what he has as in what he is .
I am aw@@ k@@ ward with numbers .
do you have any idea who did this ?
I built this do@@ gh@@ ou@@ se by myself .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to the concert because he had to work .
he &apos;s broke .
she is far from honest .
there are good grounds for the view that Paris was the scene of f@@ requ@@ ent ri@@ o@@ ts even before the re@@ volution of 17@@ 8@@ 9 .
he gave me a bri@@ ef out@@ line of the plan .
if I were you , I would ignore it .
there are four seas@@ ons in this country .
I want a don@@ ut .
I &apos;m incre@@ di@@ bly tired .
Tom has been be@@ having od@@ dly .
do you want him to know about it ?
they won the sil@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
everyone looks worried .
I ob@@ ject to her going there alone .
you &apos;re almost right .
are you going to tell him ?
you &apos;re the only one who wants to do that , aren &apos;t you ?
tell Tom I &apos;ll be there as soon as I can .
I have the best mother in the world !
we call a sandwich &quot; B@@ ut@@ ter@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
many young people are out of work in the country .
I wish you had come with us .
this lab@@ or@@ atory is where we study every day .
I like these h@@ ats .
we &apos;ll decide later .
last winter , I went skiing in Canada .
I wanted to talk to you about something .
he said that he had a lot of money .
Sami wasn &apos;t in love with Layla .
this sof@@ a can seat three people easily .
keep that thing away from me .
Sami has had a hard day .
don &apos;t expect anyone to help you .
is the dog swimming ?
please prepare for the trip .
I think Tom is a nice name .
I don &apos;t know who did that .
I write everything down ; I feel un@@ easy without my no@@ te@@ book .
that makes things clear .
you are good .
I don &apos;t see much choice .
I just don &apos;t want to see you get hurt .
are you married or single ? do you live alone or are you in a relationship ?
the sky is clear . not a clou@@ d in sight .
I &apos;m not stopping you .
P@@ e@@ e@@ ing sit@@ ting down is not all that bad .
check these out .
is he kind to you ?
we always have enough time if we use it correctly .
Tom is as tall as any student in his class is .
as yet , everything has been going well .
guess what happened to me .
your future begins today .
I think it &apos;s dangerous for children to swim in this lake .
everybody knows his name .
your sister &apos;s sleeping .
you &apos;ve bought more st@@ am@@ ps than necessary .
an en@@ orm@@ ous space station ori@@ bit@@ ing around J@@ up@@ iter over@@ looked the rain@@ bo@@ w stri@@ pes of the g@@ as gi@@ ant .
the injured were remo@@ ved from the scene .
the train is arriv@@ ing !
I &apos;ll pay you .
she was sick .
I have a coat , but I have no hat .
I know the cure for what ails you .
I just want everybody to live .
they are happy with the result .
do not be shy . your pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is more or less correct .
the air was hu@@ mi@@ d and lu@@ ke@@ warm .
of course , we believe you .
I want to meet with Tom .
it almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day .
she is as flat as a pan@@ cake .
this article is more interesting than the previous one .
do you hit your children ?
beau@@ ty pl@@ eases the eyes , kin@@ dness en@@ ch@@ ants the soul .
our plan went wrong from the beginning .
I don &apos;t enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around .
this is one of the reasons why I love Tatoeba .
do you still need tea ?
a child should not get more spen@@ ding money than is necessary .
the pizza is cold .
&quot; are you a teacher ? &quot; &quot; so I am . &quot;
I was surprised by his sudden appear@@ ance .
no one could den@@ y this .
Tom ran out of mat@@ ches so he couldn &apos;t light the fire .
I &apos;ve never been to a professional bas@@ eball game .

I &apos;d like to get away from Boston for a few days .
Tom is je@@ al@@ ous .

Tom is watching .
bes@@ ides the rain , we experienced heavy win@@ ds .
he comes from a small but we@@ alth@@ y town .
I am game !
Tom seems to be in love .
Pen@@ ance is one of the seven sac@@ ram@@ ents .
he asked me if I wanted to go abroad .
we want to leave .
I &apos;m sorry for re@@ pro@@ aching you .
does Tom still rely on his parents ?
I don &apos;t believe it happened that way .
I &apos;m no friend of yours .
I just wanted clari@@ fication .
let &apos;s worry about that later .
he hurt his fin@@ ger with a nee@@ dle .
she did her best to res@@ cue him .
I figured out a way to make more money .
this job gives me the hum@@ p .
I didn &apos;t tell you everything .
the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y came true .
I hate people who have feelings .
have a nice weekend !
&quot; so , you &apos;ll go out with me if I don &apos;t have to repe@@ at a year ? &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t care for &apos; what if &apos; stor@@ ies . &quot;
I &apos;ve got something better in mind .

try hard to hold it ti@@ ght !
do you have any idea what you &apos;re saying ?
you don &apos;t sound enti@@ rely convin@@ ced .
the boy is afraid to go to bed in the dark .
I believe it to be he .
you aren &apos;t looking .
are you lost ?
Tom put on his coat and left .
it &apos;s a quar@@ ter to two .
can I say it al@@ ou@@ d ?
she was on the scene of the crime .
it makes no fu@@ cking sense .
his eyes were sm@@ iling behind his glasses .
miss S@@ a@@ to is the president &apos;s new secre@@ tary .
Tom doesn &apos;t take very good care of his children .
I &apos;m in bed .
when is something art ?
please make five copies of this document .
do you have your p@@ ills ?

I &apos;m not going , and that &apos;s that .
a fish le@@ ap@@ ed out of the water .
I think we &apos;re going to stay for another day .
it &apos;s said that nothing is more preci@@ ous than time .
are there any bag@@ s in this shop ?
hurry up , girls .
you &apos;ll be ready .
that was very rude .
he &apos;s painting his house .
Tom looks like a foreigner .
I had two copies of the book .
I did it in a hurry .
please tell me which bus to take to go down@@ town .
tell me what you did on your holidays .
I think you need someone to talk to .
I still love this bicycle .
I &apos;ve learned so much from my mistakes , I &apos;m thinking of making a few more ! !
there is nothing like sleep .
your watch is ten minutes slow .
I am a student at O@@ x@@ for@@ d University .
you must come .
I know you aren &apos;t a doctor .
it will snow tomorrow .
you &apos;re too n@@ ai@@ ve .
his be@@ ard was th@@ ick and red .
I wonder if he &apos;s really sick .
we &apos;re ashamed of our father &apos;s po@@ ver@@ ty .
that &apos;s interesting .
I didn &apos;t know where Tom was going , but I had a good idea where he might be going .
I &apos;ve been working on this for months .
what year were you born ?
please drop in when you happen to be in the neigh@@ bor@@ hood .
he is e@@ ager to please .
I didn &apos;t catch your last name .
we &apos;re both witnesses .
you &apos;ll feel better after a b@@ ath .
you don &apos;t have permission to do that .
I don &apos;t need any rest .
all took part in the negoti@@ ations .
his father won &apos;t come . he &apos;s very busy .
the patient was dis@@ charged from hospital .
do you think Tom can return ?
I have no money to buy the dictionary .
Sami refused to talk .
I hope you &apos;re happy , too .
I had no place else to go .
I had been studying music in Boston before I re@@ turned to Japan .
she visited the old man in the hospital every day but Sunday .
she came to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese .
please take your time before deci@@ ding what to do .
I was ab@@ du@@ cted and im@@ pregn@@ ated by w@@ ol@@ ves who land@@ ed their fl@@ ying s@@ auc@@ er in my back@@ y@@ ard .
why did God create the universe ?
pass me the sugar , please .
that was cool .
is this one of your cre@@ ations ?
there was a heavy rain last night .
let her go .
there &apos;s been another accident .
didn &apos;t I mention that ?
I didn &apos;t tell him you were coming .
the man was young .
anyone can do it .
he is still having doub@@ ts .
they like English .
listen to me , he said col@@ dly , my father was the king of K@@ ak@@ on@@ go .
this dress would look good on you .
I &apos;m telling you the truth .
she wore a red bl@@ ou@@ se .
I stayed home for a week .
you may be right .
always .
that &apos;s so@@ ft .
the town was full of activity .
leave him alone .
I had no intention of doing so .
the Earth and S@@ un are just tin@@ y do@@ ts among the bil@@ li@@ ons of stars in the M@@ il@@ ky W@@ ay G@@ ala@@ x@@ y .
I suggest we go out for a drink .
maybe you should just leave Tom alone .
do you recogni@@ ze the man in this photo ?
I want to join your team .
don &apos;t speak so fast .
I can hear a cat s@@ cr@@ at@@ ching at the window .
there is a caf@@ eter@@ ia in the university .
I didn &apos;t know you had so many cats .
and who was the other ?
they have an extra bed .
you should take care of your@@ selves .
be kind to little animals .
I don &apos;t think I could do that .
something is slow@@ ing down my computer .
my computer cr@@ ash@@ ed and now it won &apos;t start up .
when the desire for leisure is str@@ on@@ ger than the other ur@@ ges , leisure w@@ ins .
we still have more than hal@@ f@@ way to go to get to the top of the mountain . are you really already exhausted ?
few students can read L@@ atin .
how many hours a day do you spend in your office ?
I know this is hard for you to understand .
I finally found a use for this old thing .
I want to warm myself .
you must do it .
I &apos;m sorry to bother you , but we &apos;ve got a small problem .
I admire your determin@@ ation .
they all went to the restaurant .
I &apos;m sure I can persu@@ ade Tom .
I told you it was going to be cold here .
do you want to talk about anything ?
Tom wants to stay single .
I &apos;m looking forward to summer vacation .
I made a pot ro@@ ast .
is she still single ?
she is not as beautiful as her older sister .
he &apos;s rich as Cro@@ es@@ us .
don &apos;t do@@ dge the question .
why does Tom want this information ?
what would you say ?
W@@ ho@@ ever kno@@ cks get opened up to .
Tom gave me a bicycle .
Tom seems lost .
he bought a do@@ z@@ en eggs .
you mis@@ understood me .
I don &apos;t know either of his bro@@ thers .
you &apos;re very busy .
they will hold talks tomorrow .
did you write that ?
I wanted to protect you .
we asked our teacher : &quot; where will the wedding be held ? &quot;
only a miracle may get him out of it .
can I see your driver &apos;s license ?
this should solve all your problems .
the man reading a newspaper is his father .
I never drink beer before lunch .
did you have any luck ?
I &apos;m a str@@ anger here .
someone threw a rock at him .
he kissed me on the fore@@ head .
Maria didn &apos;t suspect that &quot; Tom , &quot; her pen @-@ friend , with whom she had been correspon@@ ding for months over the Internet and whom she secre@@ tly loved , without ever having met him , was actually a super @-@ intelligent squir@@ rel .
I &apos;m still at school .
how could you do it to me ?
3 cu@@ bed is 27 .
how did you get interested in art ?
a dog sel@@ dom b@@ ites unless it is att@@ acked .
it &apos;s something my sister never wanted to do .
Tom maintained that he was innocent .
he is a man who is fond of ceremony .
if only you &apos;d thought of that before sho@@ o@@ ting your big m@@ outh off .
he is very afraid of dogs .
I &apos;ll let you know when it &apos;s done .
that is ordinary @-@ looking .
you look pale as a g@@ ho@@ st .
catch you later .
I really don &apos;t want to talk about it .
can you help look after the kids ?
philo@@ so@@ ph@@ y is often regarded as difficult .
the radio doesn &apos;t work .
he died five years ago .
I knew we should &apos;ve tried to help Tom .
let &apos;s re@@ consider the problem .
can you help us ?
we did not expect him to finish the task in so short a time .
the space bar is an al@@ ph@@ an@@ u@@ mer@@ ical ke@@ y@@ board &apos;s key .
that job is impossible for me to do .
there is much sugar in this black box .
our mother had no choice but to make dinner with le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
these two lines cut across each other at right angles .
she doesn &apos;t care how she dres@@ ses .
I hate this game .
he &apos;s smart , hand@@ some and polite .
don &apos;t put all your eggs in one bas@@ ket .
they got him .
I don &apos;t sleep a lot .
when I was in New York , I happened to meet my old friend .
I want to apologize for the way I acted last night .
may you be touched by H@@ is No@@ od@@ ly Ap@@ pen@@ d@@ age .
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;re eating what the doctor told you not to eat .
yes , but they are a lot of work .
she almost fai@@ n@@ ted .
how much is the express ?
my father isn &apos;t at home .
my book is not there .
only then did I realize what he meant .
why did you buy another car ?
where did everybody go ?
it &apos;s my bad .
Tom makes big money .
you have lots of phones .
keep your eye on the ball .
I bur@@ ned my hand with an ir@@ on .
that &apos;s impossible .
we love our mother almost without know@@ ing it , without feeling it , as it is as natural as to live .
it scared me .
when I &apos;m hot , a glass of cool water really ref@@ res@@ h@@ es me .
can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is ?
the ste@@ w sm@@ ells deli@@ cious .
Tom talks very fast .
please give me the book .
I &apos;m a little bit hungry .
&quot; why is your room pin@@ k , Tom ? &quot; &quot; Oh , this was my sister &apos;s room before . &quot;
I &apos;m loved .
you still haven &apos;t finished paying for your washing machine ?
there is a rock in my sho@@ e .
this dog will protect us .
Tom is a di@@ ve master .
I &apos;m going to learn German .
can I go to bed now ?
I can teach you something .
it &apos;s unfor@@ gi@@ v@@ able to date such a broken man , dar@@ ling !
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be by your side during this pain@@ ful or@@ deal .
look at this m@@ ess .
he is anything but a reli@@ able man .
Tom probably can &apos;t do that as well as I can .
sugar is solu@@ ble in water .
what do you think of Mary &apos;s new dress ?
I have a lot of problems .
it &apos;s not enough to mem@@ ori@@ ze the for@@ mul@@ as . you need to know how to use them .
what &apos;s a beautiful woman like you doing in a place like this ?
what did you expect to happen ?
maybe you &apos;re right , after all .
Mary is flu@@ ent in German , but with a s@@ light Amer@@ ican accent .
she always expec@@ ts me to help her .
go and speak to my col@@ le@@ ague .
I do want to see you .
he was s@@ l@@ ain in batt@@ le .
were you busy ?
nobody &apos;s going to bl@@ ame you .
I like cats .
why don &apos;t you use a ham@@ mer ?
can you still remember the time we first met ?
I reached the h@@ ill@@ top exactly at five .
it was tru@@ ly a miracle .
what &apos;s your final destination ?
once upon a time there was a poor man and a rich woman .
what are you going to do tonight ?
a bookke@@ e@@ per compu@@ tes all the company &apos;s income and expenses each week .
I went , too .
I don &apos;t know why I even bother anymore .
he has a video .
I &apos;m a woman , in case you &apos;re wonder@@ ing .
I &apos;d rather do this alone .
I can recomm@@ end this restaurant .
the employee was es@@ cor@@ ted off the premises .
Tom and only Tom can do it .
why don &apos;t you start by telling us who went with you ?
Kate has been given an opportunity to play a major role in a movie .
I appreciate what you did yesterday .
show us the strai@@ ght pa@@ th .
he did what I told him to do .
can you go to the office by train ?
the teacher was disappointed at my answer .
we ren@@ ov@@ ated a house .
who taught you French ?
you &apos;re the pret@@ ti@@ est woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
I can &apos;t help you because I am busy .
I can &apos;t wait for Tom to come home so I can show him this .
get out of bed .
they ru@@ ined it .
he works under me .
you have to see it .
if anyone knows anything , please let me know .
there are many par@@ ks in our town .
you must teach me , one of these days .
there is nothing like cold beer on a hot day .
tell Tom what you mean .
unfortunately , I already have plans for that day .
are you sure we have enough beer ?
the whole city was dev@@ a@@ st@@ ated by water .
I have plenty of friends .
excuse me , but I think this is my seat .
this is an op@@ ti@@ cal illu@@ sion .
let &apos;s move !
it was a gam@@ ble .
my father and I will fish once in a while .
my wife often r@@ ings me up , while she trav@@ els abroad .
why does Tom have a gun ?
you touched my heart .
they got to be good friends .
excuse me sir , could you tell me where the place of the cinema located ?
what are you watching ?
what has he done to you ?
ignore him .
it &apos;s his first time .
that would be a good idea .
that would be w@@ ic@@ ked !
I saw a drunk l@@ ying on the road .
I don &apos;t really feel like reading .
I didn &apos;t have much time .
everything is becoming more and more compli@@ cated .
every day you should at least listen to a short song , read a good po@@ em , look at a beautiful picture , and , if possible , say several intelligent words .
this is really too much .
I had to leave W@@ ar@@ saw and make my living somewhere else .
B@@ ab@@ yl@@ on was famous for its hang@@ ing gar@@ d@@ ens .
I can &apos;t be seen with you .
the enemy dro@@ pped many bo@@ mb@@ s on the fac@@ tory .
I &apos;m here all the time .
did you understand any of that ?
I have no words .
don &apos;t forget to answer his letter .
don &apos;t forget to bring kitchen u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils such as kni@@ ves and cooking po@@ ts .
no , that &apos;s not true . Tom didn &apos;t change his name . it &apos;s just a rum@@ our .

it was a close game .
whose is the dictionary on the table ?
just behave your@@ selves .

she &apos;s bright and arti@@ cul@@ ate .
I &apos;ve never been to a professional bas@@ eball game .
we got along fam@@ ously .
the capital of B@@ ra@@ z@@ il is B@@ ras@@ il@@ ia .
where did you go ?
he decided to have the operation .
Na@@ omi has just finished her work .
he married my cousin .
I had a hard time trying to persu@@ ade him to cancel the trip .
she is very shy and fe@@ els ill at ease at parties .
I feel bless@@ ed .
in the late 20@@ th century , Y@@ u@@ go@@ s@@ lav@@ ia was considered a ro@@ gue state by the United States .
that &apos;s what I &apos;d want .
hand me the ham@@ mer .
kids do stupid things .
you &apos;re very intelligent .
it &apos;s all negoti@@ able .
she touched my shou@@ l@@ der .
she went there yesterday .
there &apos;s a lot of traffic today .
your face is always di@@ r@@ ty .
it happened here .
I &apos;ll fix a drink .
I &apos;d be disappointed if I saw you doing that .
I &apos;ll take the next train .
if we had known that , we would &apos;ve come sooner .
I can &apos;t be mani@@ pul@@ ated .
what do you think of his sugges@@ tion ?
open those doors !
didn &apos;t you read the manual ?
he wants a play@@ mate .
she spen@@ ds all of her money on clothes .
Dan &apos;s message was insul@@ ting .

pick@@ pock@@ ets targ@@ et tour@@ ists .
I know you did this .
that looks like the work of a virus .
fuck your mom , bit@@ ch .
he who is not satisfied with a little , is satisfied with nothing .
why don &apos;t you try a different t@@ ack ?
I have been wan@@ ting to ask you a question .
why not just kno@@ ck on the door ?
in France , where the site was founded , Tatoeba has become a cultural and social ph@@ en@@ omen@@ on .
I speak Kur@@ man@@ j@@ i .
I have to be home tonight before it gets dark .
I slept all day .
it &apos;s a mag@@ nifi@@ cent view , isn &apos;t it ?
a small lum@@ p of sugar , please .
what does this have to do with me ?
she has good sense .
he works in a bank .
if you &apos;re busy , I &apos;ll help you .
do you remember what you were watching ?
keep your hands up .
how fast !
I left it un@@ lo@@ cked .
go sit in the car .
when I grow up I want to be just like you .
it &apos;s nice to live in this country .
it was not easy for us to find his house .
he is a lo@@ v@@ able person .
&quot; do you have a n@@ ick@@ name ? &quot; &quot; yes , it &apos;s R@@ ick . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t speak my language .
don &apos;t inter@@ fe@@ re in others &apos; affairs .
you can fo@@ ol all the people some of the time , and some of the people all the time , but you cannot fo@@ ol all the people all the time .
the pressure is building .
close the fu@@ cking door !
he is interested in music .
reading books is my hobby .
I like my st@@ ea@@ k r@@ are .
I never thought I &apos;d get that lucky .
Tom speaks French very flu@@ ently .
unfortunately , that hasn &apos;t been possible .
I thought he would come .
I want this one myself .
it &apos;ll cost around thirty dollars .
he can &apos;t read it .
my sister &apos;s guit@@ ar is new .
Tom was lucky .
the little kids were very curi@@ ous .
C@@ ap@@ itu@@ late !
Tom told me that he &apos;d be late .
these shoes are too big for me .
what &apos;s the other condition ?
you know nothing of the world .
what do you think about this plan ?
I will .
I ad@@ mit that at first I didn &apos;t like you .
we can &apos;t give up .
do you have a problem ?
the play@@ ers on this team are all gi@@ ants .
this one is the worst .
I was on the bus .
Tom has a secret wea@@ pon .
you won &apos;t be disappointed .
it was so still that you would have heard a pin drop .
I am so busy that I can &apos;t help you .
see you tomorrow !
he would be very glad to hear the news .
Dan spent the night having sex with Linda .
don &apos;t use your real name .
this book is really small !
Ko@@ al@@ as are cute .
I &apos;m never hap@@ pier than when I &apos;m by myself .
must I leave at once ?
a book worth reading is worth reading twice .
was anybody hurt ?
it &apos;s double plea@@ sure to dec@@ ei@@ ve the dec@@ ei@@ ver .
all you have to do is talk .
he can speak Russian , too .
get the fuck out !
he enjo@@ ys good health .
all the swe@@ et talk was just a r@@ use to get her into bed .
Mi@@ h@@ o plays piano better than Nor@@ ik@@ o .
it means that he likes you .
I knew it would happen sooner or later .
Tom is real cute .
they made me go there .
I don &apos;t know how to sp@@ ell that word .
is this all yours ?
Dan tou@@ ted his racist id@@ eas to his friends .
I don &apos;t like cold weather , but Tom does .
the cap@@ tain invited her for breakfast .
I live here alone .

there &apos;s really nothing more we can do .
I can &apos;t forgive him for be@@ having like that .
what would you do ?
Tom wouldn &apos;t let anybody help him .
Mary sings best of all of the girls in class .
does anyone know what this is ?
you speak good French !
do you want help with that ?
I can &apos;t do it alone . you have to help me .
I &apos;m talking non@@ sense .
you don &apos;t seem to realize how serious this is .
Tom won &apos;t bother you anymore .
why did you come here today ?
that &apos;s more rec@@ ent than you think it is .
how can I u@@ plo@@ ad a photo to your website ?
I know that the last thing you want to do is help me .

some s@@ na@@ kes are pois@@ on@@ ous .
Tom didn &apos;t want me to touch him .

it &apos;s been a long time since I &apos;ve seen any dr@@ ag@@ on@@ f@@ lies in this area .
Tom wants to say yes , but he can &apos;t .
you must listen .
he was be@@ aten too easily .
they slept in the same bed .

I finally found time to sit down and read the newspaper .
I &apos;ll bet you can &apos;t guess what happened to me today .
do you know when he &apos;ll come back ?
would you mind if I kissed you ?
in English there are some words bor@@ ro@@ wed from Japanese .
Sami will spend life behind b@@ ars .

it is not you but her that he wants to marry .
no one knows where he lives .
I like to fish in the river .
I would rather walk than wait for the next bus .
I &apos;m ready to fight .
it &apos;s sometimes necessary not to tell the truth .
what on earth is an inter@@ ro@@ ban@@ g ‽
you &apos;re not bad looking either .
what is wrong with him ?
it &apos;s not his style .
she &apos;s quite a hand@@ ful .

does this hurt ?
she doesn &apos;t speak much .
she knew too much .
he excel@@ s all his bro@@ thers in scho@@ l@@ as@@ tic ability .
what &apos;re you doing here ?
the doctor att@@ ended to the sick old man all night , pour@@ ing shot after shot of wh@@ is@@ key into the old man &apos;s open m@@ outh until he died .
Tom shouldn &apos;t be punished ; he didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
you &apos;ve got to learn to be careful .
&quot; thank you . &quot; &quot; you &apos;re welcome . &quot;
you missed the meeting .
I left the keys in the ig@@ ni@@ tion .
where is the toilet ?
can I buy only the len@@ ses ?

Tom watched clo@@ sel@@ y .
why do you work here ?
I &apos;m afraid you have the wrong number .
you liked chocol@@ ate .
I try to be aggres@@ sive .
I &apos;m in love with somebody else .
the keys were in my bag .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
just exactly what do you want me to do ?
wasn &apos;t it enough ?
Tom has two jobs .
she &apos;s a determined woman .
how are you going to stop Tom ?
do you really want me to start ?

you &apos;re a cute girl .
I knew we were going to get married the moment I met you .
father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do .
he had no idea what to expect .
I &apos;d like you to meet a friend of mine .

come back tomorrow .
we have nothing in common .
the bu@@ ds began to burst .
I have to go upstairs .
Dan shot Mat@@ t in self @-@ def@@ ence .

Tom was in love with Maria , but she didn &apos;t want to know anything about him .
the man died a few hours ago .
I admire Tom &apos;s pers@@ ever@@ ance .
she has a thing for older men .
everything &apos;s going to work out .
the T@@ ick@@ Dis@@ play fun@@ ction has to be called every fr@@ ame in order to play the ani@@ mation .

the past is no longer and the future is not yet .
I don &apos;t know how I &apos;ve off@@ ended you .
Mary thinks that O@@ liv@@ er is spen@@ ding too much time playing vide@@ o@@ games .
I &apos;ve done that coun@@ t@@ less times .
you guys are aw@@ es@@ o@@ me .
we know that you &apos;re sick .
I &apos;d take it if I were you .
did you go to the restaurant yesterday ?
she found him standing near the entrance .
put the car into the garage .
I expect you to be punctual .
what was the first concert you went to ?
has Tom been fir@@ ed ?
he moves quickly .
the baby fell asleep in the cr@@ ad@@ le .
we looked around the property .
I can hold my bre@@ ath for a long time .
that &apos;s another matter .
we haven &apos;t seen you in a while .
this is something I must face alone .
what do I mean to you ?
I suggest you co@@ operate .
we were medi@@ oc@@ re .
mea@@ sure twice , cut once .
I didn &apos;t take the time to do it proper@@ ly .
that &apos;s a really great idea .
time is more preci@@ ous than anything else .
where are they swimming ?
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m talking to you about this .
M@@ et@@ e@@ or@@ o@@ logis@@ ts are people who know a trem@@ end@@ ous amount about ge@@ op@@ h@@ ysi@@ cs , ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics and cli@@ ma@@ to@@ logy , and almost nothing about tomorrow &apos;s weather .
we have to find a way to get that done .
I fol@@ ded the to@@ wel@@ s .
I have low blood pressure .

I told you not to come here .

I found my bicycle gone .

Tom has decided to have the surgery that his doctor recommended .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .

when ice mel@@ ts , it becomes li@@ qui@@ d .
Tom was mau@@ led by a dog when he was a k@@ id .
we sw@@ am in the sea .
he slept until ten o &apos;clock .
the Earth is just a little is@@ land and we are little is@@ land@@ ers .
she is a good li@@ ar .
I am not busy .
why don &apos;t we all go ?
let me put this in pers@@ pe@@ ctive for you .
nobody des@@ er@@ ves that .
I want to speak to my lawyer now .
can you tell us how that &apos;ll work ?
I love my y@@ el@@ low swe@@ ater .
you shall have a bicycle for your birthday .
she made it pl@@ ain that she wanted to go to col@@ lege .
I was a shy child .
I suppose it makes sense to go a@@ head and pay the bill right now .
he is ashamed to ask questions .
I can &apos;t turn it on , because the s@@ wit@@ ch is broken .
these clothes are di@@ r@@ ty and need to be wash@@ ed .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll leave early .
they &apos;re reading a book .
Al@@ fr@@ ed , K@@ ing of England , was a great scho@@ lar as well as a great ru@@ ler .
you need to sleep .
&quot; Oh ! they &apos;ll find him guil@@ ty , &quot; said the other . &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid of that . &quot;
I am lost .
he is getting better .
don &apos;t leave me alone .
everyday life can get a bit mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous at times .
was V@@ en@@ us , a des@@ ert planet with th@@ ick clou@@ ds of sul@@ fu@@ ri@@ c a@@ ci@@ d , fore@@ telling the future of Earth ?

that has nothing to do with him .
we call him Mi@@ ke .
how did you get into our room ?
everybody had a hard time .
I &apos;d like some sugar , please .
I am trying to ju@@ gg@@ le .
Sami used to wear glasses all the time .
I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
you must pay attention to his advice .
I don &apos;t think your seeing him is good for you .
he is a true co@@ lo@@ s@@ sus .
I may know someone who can help you .
here we are .
the society in which they live is very different from our own .
she wrote a lot of po@@ ems .
I want to talk to you .
he was born in Ro@@ me .
how did you become involved in this project ?
either you or I must go in his place .
with all his faul@@ ts , he is respec@@ ted by everybody .
what a tr@@ ag@@ e@@ dy !
Tom hardly ever we@@ ars a tie .
I painted a picture for you .
he likes to talk about himself .
there was a kno@@ ck on the door .
how did you know that man was a co@@ p ?
how did you get into my house ?
I &apos;m not a great photo@@ grap@@ her .
it &apos;s like one of those .
she s@@ cru@@ b@@ bed the kitchen floor with a br@@ ush .
those doors should be closed .
what would you do in my place ?
I go to any party I am invited to .
there are four seas@@ ons in a year - spring , summer , fall , and winter .
I want to help you get out of this m@@ ess .
Sami was already on the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ aster .
get moving !
I must be leaving now .

Justice in this country is a bit of a double stand@@ ard : there is the justice of the poor and the justice of the rich .
I don &apos;t eat out very often .
&quot; let &apos;s play Ho@@ p S@@ ki@@ p An@@ d Ju@@ m@@ p like me , &quot; said the little white rab@@ bit .
I wonder what all of them have in common .
what was the cause of the explo@@ sion ?
I &apos;ll get my keys .

may I introdu@@ ce myself ?
left @-@ hand th@@ read@@ s have now become un@@ su@@ al in me@@ chan@@ ics but they can still be found on some obj@@ ects , such as on bic@@ yc@@ les &apos; ped@@ als , for inst@@ ance .
the B@@ BC is my favour@@ ite chan@@ nel .
I paid two hundred dollars in taxes .
congratul@@ ations , and thanks for everything !
he t@@ ends to be arrogant .
we remember .
it is free of charge .
will he succe@@ ed or fai@@ l ?
I just don &apos;t like it .
Ju@@ dg@@ ing from his appear@@ ance , he must be a rich man .
I want to apologize to all of you for what just happened .
I never thought I &apos;d see her there .
I think we still have plenty of time .
what should we buy with this money ?
I &apos;m making an appointment for my daughter .
he succeeded to his uncle &apos;s fortune .
Dan didn &apos;t know where his car key was .
I miss you all the time .
you are a trou@@ bl@@ em@@ ak@@ er .
will you go to the dance with me ?
it &apos;s expensive to mo@@ derni@@ ze a city .

you &apos;re invited .
I &apos;m talking with R@@ oc@@ í@@ o .
let me see .
women often paint their fin@@ ger@@ n@@ ails .
they &apos;re not a thre@@ at .
Tom won &apos;t believe it .
that guy &apos;s a friend of mine .
Australia is about tw@@ enty times larger than Japan .
she cut the cake in two .
you handled that well .
I didn &apos;t know why Tom didn &apos;t want us there .
let &apos;s drink to his success .
I thought you were my friend .
do you know her at all ?
I can &apos;t hear you very well .
Sami isn &apos;t jo@@ king .
I suppose you know all about it .
I &apos;m going to sit on the ben@@ ch over there next to the street lam@@ p .
An@@ tar@@ es is a red st@@ ar .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I have a friend in Spain who speaks five languages .
is today your birthday ?
let &apos;s go to Paul &apos;s D@@ iner .
you ought to be quiet in a library .
Tom fell asleep waiting for Mary .
V@@ en@@ us is only slightly smaller than the Earth and M@@ ars is bigg@@ er than half of Earth .
do you find that washing machine easy to use ?
she committed a crime .
I am not in@@ so@@ lent towards them .
it is easy to distingu@@ ish good from ev@@ il .
how is your dad ?
bring them to me .
we did not help him , so he made it by himself .
right now , I want to speak Lo@@ j@@ ban .
Tom drinks at least three lit@@ ers of water every day .
I &apos;ve been looking fo@@ ward to meeting you .
the th@@ r@@ ush sings each song twice over .
do you know if he is available ? I need to know in order to make an appointment with him .
don &apos;t forget about me .
we lost against our ri@@ v@@ al on price .
let me buy you a drink .
if you were in my place , what would you do ?
because I speak Chinese .
have you been told the reasons why we didn &apos;t hire you ?
do you watch television ?
I never should &apos;ve let you go home alone last night .
do you like Mo@@ s@@ co@@ w ?
he &apos;s hel@@ l @-@ b@@ ent on finding out who killed his daughter .
that bed is very comfortable .
the criminal is sure to do time for ro@@ bb@@ ing the store .
my children are hungry .
I &apos;m sure that Tom is honest .
her belie@@ f in God is very firm .
he was killed .
no one was in the room .
I can &apos;t believe I &apos;m telling you this .
language refl@@ ects daily experience .
Tom began to shi@@ ver viol@@ ently .
S@@ tr@@ ang@@ ely enough , he failed .
he should get to your house in an hour .
may we use the language la@@ b ?
you forgot to practice ?
everybody saw it .
that &apos;s enough now !
it &apos;s just five in the morning , but n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless it is light out .
I didn &apos;t move a thing .
my father was a doctor .
in many ways , these fo@@ ss@@ ils are the &apos; smoking gun &apos; just before the emer@@ gen@@ ce of our own gen@@ us .
there &apos;s no ur@@ gency .
how far do we have to go ?
children grow very quickly .
are you on your way home ?
how can it be that mathematics , being after all a produ@@ ct of human thought independent of experience , is so admi@@ r@@ ably adap@@ ted to the obj@@ ects of re@@ ality ?
it &apos;s his word against h@@ ers .
which col@@ or do you prefer , blue or gre@@ en ?
the Ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ c G@@ ames cer@@ em@@ oni@@ ously celebr@@ ate the tri@@ um@@ p@@ h of nation@@ alism , do@@ ping and commer@@ ce .
in the val@@ le@@ y , the viol@@ ets came out early .
C@@ y@@ pr@@ us is an is@@ land .
her skin was almost trans@@ lu@@ cent .
how could I forget ?
let me buy you a new one .
Tom is smart .
let us sing a song .
I had a couple of questions , but I didn &apos;t ask them .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ine logi@@ c is not always logical .
when we started out , our band could only find small clubs in small cities that would hire us .
you should respect the rules your parents set for you .
don &apos;t tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend .
I told you I have a girlfriend .
I need you right now .
Sami saw Layla hur@@ r@@ ying .
leave our house .
I &apos;ll lend it to you .
I may need to move on .
I believe that he &apos;s happy .
quit talking , will you ?
they set out for New York .
I desp@@ ise them .
my cat slept next to me .
forgive me .
the floor is covered with a th@@ ick car@@ pe@@ t .
Tom has a small far@@ m not far from Boston .
an animal can be much more dangerous when w@@ oun@@ ded .
can you drive a sti@@ ck shi@@ ft ?
I go to the theatre .
Dan par@@ ked the rental car near the police station .
where do you want to go for our first lesson ?
man is the dog &apos;s best friend .
Tom wonder@@ ed why Mary had stayed in Boston .
I wonder if there &apos;s some way of at@@ trac@@ ting more Japanese spea@@ kers to Tatoeba ?
there were no b@@ ounds to his ambi@@ tion .
P@@ ine@@ apple is rich in ci@@ tric a@@ ci@@ d .
we are going to the country .
I know what it &apos;s like to be he@@ ar@@ t@@ broken .
how did it come about ?
whose turn is it to make dinner tonight ?
I thought you &apos;d want to see this movie .
did I do all that ?
we &apos;re lucky to be alive .
you can drive a car , can &apos;t you ?
as soon as we got to the lake , we started swimming .
yesterday , he told me the truth .
giving up smoking is the easi@@ est thing in the world . I know because I &apos;ve done it thousands of times .
the dog is thirsty .
I heard that a g@@ ay pri@@ est had been promo@@ ted to the r@@ ank of bis@@ ho@@ p , but it turned out to be a f@@ ab@@ ri@@ cation .
the food isn &apos;t very good here .
what do you mean , &quot; I don &apos;t like it &quot; ?
he had long hair last year .
your question has no answer .
how aw@@ ful !
I hate it when my parents fight .
he who does not work does not have the right to eat .
don &apos;t be a str@@ anger .
I know Tom is all right now .
Tom said he would try .
we need to correct those mis@@ taken as@@ sum@@ ptions .
I would think you have other things to keep you busy .
Sami was five minutes away .
Tom is coming to our school tomorrow .
she loved her mother de@@ arly .
I plea@@ ded not guil@@ ty .
we can &apos;t post@@ po@@ ne the meeting .
you aren &apos;t invited .
long live the ger@@ i@@ oc@@ racy !
she cannot play the piano .
men only think about one thing .
he didn &apos;t do that out of mean@@ ness , but rather out of absent @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
yes , I am married .
never talk to str@@ angers .
how could you do that ?
I had to go back .
I have a pre@@ d@@ il@@ ection for be@@ ef .
you have everything .
Tom told me Mary was busy .
I want to see it .
they must be crazy to believe such non@@ sense .
I want you to be quiet .
C@@ ot@@ ton ab@@ sor@@ bs water .
get back to where you started .
I had to work on Sunday .
you guys su@@ ck .
who &apos;s going to cook for us ?
what language were they speaking ?
never tell lies .
both alternatives are possible .
maybe I should also add sentences without translations ? it is a very fast way of impro@@ ving the popul@@ ar@@ ity of one &apos;s own language .
do you want to bet on that ?
we made sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces .
I had only one drink .
I &apos;ve cho@@ sen her to be my wife .
I can &apos;t kiss you the way you want to be kissed .
stop tw@@ is@@ ting my arm !
if he s@@ ends me any letters , I just t@@ ear them up and throw them away .
I was warned .
sooner or later , Tom will likely agree to help us .
this is longer than any other bri@@ dge in the world .
what &apos;s the teacher expl@@ aining ?
we &apos;d like separate chec@@ ks .
who wouldn &apos;t want to live here ?
we &apos;re cross@@ ing the border .
who is next ?
are you sure you &apos;re warm enough ?
I don &apos;t know who my anc@@ est@@ ors are . our pa@@ pers got lost during the F@@ lo@@ od .
sit down and shut up .
it &apos;ll rain for sure .
it &apos;s not on the men@@ u .
Tom is the only one who doesn &apos;t know .
I went to the supermar@@ ket .
D@@ ro@@ pl@@ ets are falling on my lap@@ top computer .
I am sure .
I believe him to be intelligent .
I study English at home .
I &apos;m still a member .
this kind of work makes me hungry .
smoking is bad for your health .
In@@ de@@ ed , d@@ war@@ f to@@ ss@@ ing is an Ol@@ ym@@ pi@@ c sport !
yes , I &apos;m afraid so .
you should keep your promises .
I just want to be perfect .
I &apos;m glad I invited you .
there is only one truth .
man has a great capacity to adap@@ t to environ@@ mental changes .
I wonder what has become of him after he went to America .
I don &apos;t have much interest in cooking .
Tom asked me to be here .
you look gor@@ ge@@ ous in that dress .
he isn &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
I still can &apos;t believe I &apos;m going to be on your team .
come and keep me company .
why are you pic@@ king a fight with me ?
his kin@@ dness touched my heart .
he studies bio@@ logy very hard .
my uncle is rich .
to be perfect she l@@ acked just one defect .
I hear him falling .
you don &apos;t have to be a victim .
which way is the beach ?
I just need you to help me .
can I have some more ri@@ ce , please ?
don &apos;t talk rubbish !
Sami lived very close to the location where Layla &apos;s body was found .
the suspect is a cau@@ ca@@ sian fem@@ ale .
he painted a dog .
where did you hide the food ?
I get ch@@ apped li@@ ps every winter .
they dec@@ ei@@ ved us .
my feet are cold .
Mary accepted everything without compl@@ aining .
he &apos;s an ex@@ or@@ c@@ ist .
it &apos;s your turn to sing .
they were s@@ col@@ ded by the teacher .
our esca@@ pe was nothing short of a miracle .
I &apos;ll never do this again .
I sur@@ vi@@ ved .
this glass isn &apos;t mine .
it &apos;s hard to choose .
my dog has cancer .
do you remember the day this picture was taken ?
what did she do to you ?
Cre@@ ating Tatoeba was a good idea .
are you happy here ?
she che@@ ated on the test .
can I speak to you a moment ?
they stood on the h@@ ill@@ top .
I &apos;ve never felt like this before .
what &apos;s your favorite skin care produ@@ ct ?
you can borrow three books at a time .
I &apos;m in absolu@@ tely total agreement .
this car is his .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary will be tired when they get home .
I wouldn &apos;t go with you for anything .
he made up the whole story .
you &apos;re finished already .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to you .
everybody needs to know this .
fall is late this year .
they &apos;re on good terms with their neighb@@ ors .
I &apos;m using a new computer .
Mary always studies for two hours a day .
what did she do with it ?
it &apos;s a rule .
who are you closest to in your family ?
you &apos;re worse than Tom .
do the Ger@@ man@@ s have any other concer@@ ns in life a@@ part from consu@@ mer@@ ism ?
you should not respect a man because he is rich .
the ch@@ air cre@@ a@@ ked as he sat down .
he ex@@ pressed his belie@@ f in her hon@@ es@@ ty .
only they themselves understand what they say .
no , he hasn &apos;t said anything about it .
everyone is going to call me a li@@ ar .
the child was crying for her mother .
they ru@@ ined it .
they want pe@@ ace .
are we being charged with something ?
I really hate dai@@ ry products .
I was right on the spo@@ t when it happened .
be punctual .
I am four@@ teen years old .
you look so pale .
I really don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
that &apos;s it . I &apos;ve done all I can do .
the a@@ ard@@ var@@ k is a medi@@ um @-@ si@@ zed animal .
the school rules require students to wear school uni@@ forms .
where can I buy books ?
I have two eyes .
I &apos;ve remo@@ ved the com@@ ma .
do you have an extra key ?
his bad leg prev@@ ented him from win@@ ning the ra@@ ce .
you &apos;re being par@@ an@@ o@@ id .
I &apos;m lucky to have you as a friend .
I have to say that I &apos;m sorry .
I admire her efforts .
we can &apos;t get close to the enemy .
there are a lot of stars larger than our own S@@ un .
they aren &apos;t du@@ m@@ ber than you .
can &apos;t this wait until things are back to normal ?
Tom doesn &apos;t go to school yet .
my mother is a very good cook .
are you watching the presidential deb@@ ate ?
you were right .
now I am free .
who spr@@ ead these rum@@ ours ?
that was written by T@@ ar@@ o A@@ k@@ ag@@ aw@@ a .
she made it clear that she couldn &apos;t make it in time for the meeting .
I know you considered me a close friend .
things will only get worse .
the girl is drinking tea .
I &apos;m surprised to see you .
this is your faul@@ t .
she met him on the beach .
they arrived at the hotel .
is your name Layla ?
I can &apos;t do this job alone .
I had gotten no sleep the night before , so I kept dro@@ pping off during the meeting .
haven &apos;t you eaten yet ?
don &apos;t talk to me about religion .
who is there ?
he is str@@ on@@ ger than me .
I s@@ wore I &apos;d never do that .
the dog came running to me .
Tom is th@@ ro@@ wing st@@ ones at birds .
yesterday was a good day .
Tom is a bad co@@ ach .
she died last night .
I &apos;m waiting for the bus .
this ru@@ g was made without the use of child lab@@ or .
death before dis@@ hon@@ or !
I o@@ iled my bicycle .
turn around .
this is not necessary .
we want re@@ ven@@ ge .
put on your shoes . let &apos;s go out for dinner .
you &apos;re fai@@ th@@ ful .
the train should be here on time .
I &apos;d be un@@ happy if that happened again .
this show is stupid .
write Spanish .
don &apos;t even think of asking me what I think about you right now .
I don &apos;t care if it sno@@ ws .
there &apos;s someone I want you to meet .
I &apos;m not writing about you .
your question is not relevant to the subject .
she came to see me .
this ch@@ air is too small .
how much time do you actually spend thinking about the future ?
I don &apos;t know who you want to meet .
if the doors of per@@ cep@@ tion were cle@@ ans@@ ed everything would appe@@ ar to man as it is , in@@ fin@@ ite .
beer is my fu@@ el .
don &apos;t forget to ti@@ p the porter for c@@ arr@@ ying your lu@@ gg@@ age .
many great thin@@ kers who were un@@ known while alive became famous after death .
you &apos;re a terrible person .
it is difficult to get him to do anything on the s@@ pu@@ r of the moment .
in Norwegian , &apos; d &apos; and &apos; t &apos; at the end of a word are generally silent .
how many times do I have to tell you not to eat cand@@ y just before dinner ?
no one can do that .
I have some inside information about the company &apos;s plans to go public .
do you know the man star@@ ing at you ?
no sooner had he seen it than he turned pale .
everyone knows we &apos;re rich .
I appreciate the senti@@ ment .
I &apos;m rich .
finish drinking your milk .
the old man died from hun@@ ger .
2016 is coming to an end and a new year is about to begin !
you &apos;re the old@@ est .
I slept for eight hours last night .
are you here alone ?
anyone could do that .
he is good for nothing .
do you like music ?
take mine .
why don &apos;t you tell me something I don &apos;t know ?
this is not what I order@@ ed .
this is such a waste of time .
Tom is always playing video games .
I have been to the store before .
stop s@@ ending me flowers .
please un@@ dress from the wai@@ st up .
that &apos;s a stupid question !
why don &apos;t you have dinner with me tonight ?
are you ready for the trip ?
you need to be more careful from now on .
can you look at me ?
did you register your produ@@ ct ?
Dan had to decide whom to believe .
you must give up smoking , as it is un@@ healthy .
there is a television in my room .
they &apos;re looking for you .

Sami didn &apos;t really like that girl .
I can &apos;t get the ca@@ p off this bottle .
I recogni@@ zed her at first gl@@ ance .
I want to talk to you alone .
we &apos;d better leave her alone .
alth@@ ough Mary is sick , she will work .
happy is the man who is cont@@ ented .
I was bor@@ ed .
if I were healthy , I would be happy .
she has left us .
she asked him for some money .
I &apos;m not really that thirsty .
have fun with that .
there is something tr@@ op@@ ical and ex@@ o@@ tic about her which forms a sin@@ gu@@ lar contr@@ ast to her cool and un@@ em@@ o@@ tional brother .

if you want something to be done right , sometimes you &apos;ve just got to do it yourself .
the workers are against the new plan .
they stayed in the room with me for the whole night .
she gave me good advice .
Pr@@ ay for all of us .
my brother depends on me for money .
this isn &apos;t where I par@@ ked my car .
I want to sort this out once and for all .
don &apos;t let go of my hand , or you &apos;ll get lost .
