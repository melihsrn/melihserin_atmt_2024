qu&apos; est @-@ ce que la vie sans le ray@@ onnement de l&apos; amour ?
c&apos; est le lieu in@@ oubli@@ able où nous nous sommes rencontrés pour la première fois .
c&apos; est , je crois , un fait indé@@ ni@@ able que les Américains sont , en tant qu&apos; Américains , le peuple le plus conscient d&apos; eux @-@ mêmes et celui ayant le plus besoin de croire que les autres nations for@@ ment un compl@@ ot vis@@ ant à les dé@@ préci@@ er .

le lait est ai@@ g@@ re .
quiconque parle @-@ t @-@ il anglais ?
il a fait appe@@ l à nous pour avoir de l&apos; aide .
pourquoi m&apos; as @-@ tu laissé dormir si tard ?
il est peut @-@ être impossible d&apos; ob@@ tenir un Cor@@ pus complètement dénu@@ é de fautes , étant donnée la nature de ce type d&apos; entreprise collabor@@ ative . C@@ ep@@ endant , si nous encourag@@ eons les mem@@ bres à produire des phrases dans leurs propres langues plutôt que d&apos; expéri@@ men@@ ter dans les langues qu&apos; ils appr@@ ennent , nous pour@@ rions être en mesure de rédu@@ ire les erreurs .
c&apos; est la pire chose que tu puis@@ ses faire !
a @-@ t @-@ il de l&apos; expérience en ag@@ ri@@ culture ?
Tom connaît très bien la ville .

il est temps de s&apos; él@@ ever et de res@@ pl@@ en@@ di@@ r .
il l&apos; a fait quand même .
le salaire est mis@@ ér@@ able et les heures sont longues .

Tom a av@@ ou@@ é avoir accep@@ té un pot @-@ de @-@ vin .

tu dois te préparer au pire .
elles pensent que je suis milli@@ onn@@ aire .
nous l&apos; avons pris par erreur pour un Améric@@ ain .

&quot; puis @-@ je l&apos; écrire sur Tatoeba en k@@ aby@@ le ? &quot; &quot; ce que je dis appartient à l&apos; oli@@ vi@@ er , ce ne sont plus mes mots ! &quot;
peux @-@ tu voir quoi que ce soit , là ?
il avait tout faux .
donne @-@ moi un peu de temps pour réfléchir .
la situation est très compli@@ quée .
vous vous met@@ trez sans tar@@ der à l&apos; aimer .
ça doit être le fac@@ teur .
je pris part à la manifes@@ tation spor@@ tive .
je compatis .
je ne veux qu&apos; un supplé@@ ment de temps .
au moment où je ten@@ ais le bébé dans mes bras , il commença à pleurer .

j&apos; imagine que ce que j&apos; ai dit n&apos; est pas si clair que ça , mais c&apos; est la seule façon dont je peux l&apos; expliquer .

je ne peux le faire seul . j&apos; ai besoin de ton aide .
je ne suis pas d&apos; accord avec la théorie selon laquelle on doit apprendre le latin pour mieux comprendre l&apos; anglais .
je suis sérieux !
vous seule pouvez le faire , mais vous ne pouvez le faire seule .
vous ne voulez pas le savoir .
en quoi pensez @-@ vous que ceci soit fait ?
je dois poser quelques questions .
j&apos; ai besoin de preuves .
Tom ne chante pas très bien .
s&apos; il te plaît , viens me chercher en voiture devant l&apos; hôtel .

je ne pense pas que Tom puisse jouer de la tromp@@ ette .
je pense que ce fait est très important .
j&apos; ignore ce que je te dois .
moins on pense , plus on parle .
elle vous attend à la maison .
je n&apos; arrive pas à trouver quoi que ce soit .
j&apos; y serai à 2 h 30 .

ils ont rem@@ porté la médaille d&apos; argent .
tout le monde a l&apos; air sou@@ cieux .
je ne suis pas d&apos; accord pour qu&apos; elle y aille seule .
tu as presque raison .
tu vas lui en parler ?
tu es le seul à vouloir faire ça , n&apos; est @-@ ce pas ?
dis à Tom que je serai là dès que je pour@@ rai .
j&apos; ai la meilleure maman du monde !
nous appel@@ ons un sandwich &quot; Bu@@ t@@ ter@@ bro@@ t &quot; .

l&apos; hiver dernier je suis allé sk@@ ier au Canada .
je voulais vous parler à propos de quelque chose .
il a dit qu&apos; il avait beaucoup d&apos; argent .
Sami n&apos; était pas amoureux de Layla .
trois personnes peuvent facilement s&apos; asseoir dans ce canapé .
tenez cette chose loin de moi !
Sami a eu une dure journée .
ne vous attend@@ ez pas à ce que quiconque vous aide !
le chien est @-@ il en train de nager ?
P@@ répare @-@ toi pour le voyage , je te prie .
je pense que Tom est un joli nom .
je ne sais pas qui a fait ça .
je note tout ; je me sens mal à l&apos; aise sans mon car@@ net .
ça clari@@ fie les choses .
tu es bon .
je ne vois guère de choix .
je ne veux tout simplement pas vous voir être blessée .
êtes @-@ vous marié ou célibataire ? vivez @-@ vous seul ou en couple ?
le ciel est dé@@ gag@@ é . pas un nu@@ age en vue .

P@@ is@@ ser assi@@ se n&apos; est pas si mauvais .

est @-@ il gentil avec toi ?
nous avons toujours assez de temps , si nous l&apos; utilis@@ ons correctement .
Tom est aussi grand que n&apos; importe quel autre élève de la classe .
jusqu&apos; à présent , tout s&apos; est bien passé .
Devine ce qui m&apos; est arrivé !

je veux voir Tom .
ça m&apos; a presque fait peur de ne pas te voir conn@@ ec@@ tée pendant toute une journée .
elle n&apos; a pas de poi@@ tr@@ ine .
cet article est plus intéressant que le pré@@ cé@@ dent .
Fr@@ app@@ ez @-@ vous vos enfants ?
la beauté plaît aux yeux , la douc@@ eur char@@ me l&apos; âme .
notre plan s&apos; est mal gou@@ p@@ illé dès le départ .
je n&apos; aime pas apprendre aux enfants à nager quand leurs parents sont à côté .
c&apos; est l&apos; une des raisons pour lesquelles j&apos; adore Tatoeba .
as @-@ tu encore besoin de thé ?
un enfant ne devrait pas recev@@ oir plus d&apos; argent de poche qu&apos; il n&apos; est nécessaire .
la pizza est froide .
&quot; êtes @-@ vous enseignant ? &quot; &quot; oui , je le suis &quot; .
je fus surpris par son appar@@ ition soud@@ aine .

il m&apos; a demandé si je voulais me rendre à l&apos; étranger .
nous voulons partir .
je regrette de vous faire des repro@@ ches .
Tom dépend @-@ il encore de ses parents ?
je ne crois pas que ce soit arrivé de cette manière .
je ne compte pas au nombre de tes amis .
je voulais simplement une clari@@ fication .
Sou@@ ci@@ ons @-@ nous de cela plus tard .
il s&apos; est fait mal au doigt avec une ai@@ gu@@ ille .
elle a fait de son mieux pour le sauver .
j&apos; ai inv@@ enté un moyen de génér@@ er davantage d&apos; argent .

tous les génies ne sont pas des ingénieurs , mais tous les ingénieurs sont des génies . l&apos; ensemble de tous les ingénieurs est donc un sous @-@ ensemble , malheureusement propre , de tous les génies .
je ne pense pas que quiconque pense que tu sois fou .
Tom ignor@@ a nos conseils .
nous en au@@ rons terminé avant une heure .
je la vois rire et plais@@ an@@ ter avec eux .
il fix@@ ait son dé@@ coll@@ eté .
nous en avons déjà terminé .
nous ne sommes pas appar@@ ent@@ ées .

savez @-@ vous garder un secret ?
essaie de le tenir serré de toutes tes forces !
as @-@ tu la moindre idée de ce que tu dis ?

je crois qu&apos; il s&apos; agit de lui .
tu ne regardes pas .
es @-@ tu perdu ?
Tom en@@ fi@@ la son manteau et parti@@ t .

elle fit clairement comprendre qu&apos; elle voulait aller à l&apos; université .
j&apos; étais une enfant timide .

le passeport du président des États @-@ Unis est noir , et non pas bleu comme celui d&apos; un cit@@ o@@ yen ordinaire .
ça pourrait avoir des conséquences in@@ volontai@@ res .
qui pense @-@ t @-@ elle être ?
Tom n&apos; a pas fait de commentaire .
nous avons pris votre proposition en considér@@ ation et nous avons décidé que nous ne sommes pas en mesure de rédu@@ ire le prix .

tu as mis de la crème solaire ?
Jouons aux échecs encore une fois .

Tom n&apos; a pas du tout d&apos; argent .
Tom n&apos; a jamais dan@@ sé avec Mary .
